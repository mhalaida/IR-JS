Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms are e’en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service,—two dishes, but to one table. That’s the end.

KING.

Alas, alas!



HAMLET.

A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

KING.

What dost thou mean by this?



HAMLET.

Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.

KING.

Where is Polonius?



HAMLET.

In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there, seek him i’ th’other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.

KING.

[To some Attendants.] Go seek him there.



HAMLET.

He will stay till you come.



[Exeunt Attendants.]

KING.

Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,—

Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve

For that which thou hast done,—must send thee hence

With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself;

The bark is ready, and the wind at help,

Th’associates tend, and everything is bent

For England.



HAMLET.

For England?



KING.

Ay, Hamlet.



HAMLET.

Good.



KING.

So is it, if thou knew’st our purposes.



HAMLET.

I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.

KING.

Thy loving father, Hamlet.



HAMLET.

My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.

[Exit.]

KING.

Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard;

Delay it not; I’ll have him hence tonight.

Away, for everything is seal’d and done

That else leans on th’affair. Pray you make haste.



[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]

And England, if my love thou hold’st at aught,—

As my great power thereof may give thee sense,

Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red

After the Danish sword, and thy free awe

Pays homage to us,—thou mayst not coldly set

Our sovereign process, which imports at full,

By letters conjuring to that effect,

The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;

For like the hectic in my blood he rages,

And thou must cure me. Till I know ’tis done,

Howe’er my haps, my joys were ne’er begun.



[Exit.]





SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.


Enter Fortinbras and Forces marching.

FORTINBRAS.

Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.

Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras

Craves the conveyance of a promis’d march

Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.

If that his Majesty would aught with us,

We shall express our duty in his eye;

And let him know so.



CAPTAIN.

I will do’t, my lord.



FORTINBRAS.

Go softly on.



[Exeunt all but the Captain.]

Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern &c.

HAMLET.

Good sir, whose powers are these?



CAPTAIN.

They are of Norway, sir.



HAMLET.

How purpos’d, sir, I pray you?



CAPTAIN.

Against some part of Poland.



HAMLET.

Who commands them, sir?



CAPTAIN.

The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.



HAMLET.

Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,

Or for some frontier?



CAPTAIN.

Truly to speak, and with no addition,

We go to gain a little patch of ground

That hath in it no profit but the name.

To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;

Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole

A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.



HAMLET.

Why, then the Polack never will defend it.



CAPTAIN.

Yes, it is already garrison’d.



HAMLET.

Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats

Will not debate the question of this straw!

This is th’imposthume of much wealth and peace,

That inward breaks, and shows no cause without

Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.



CAPTAIN.

God b’ wi’ you, sir.



[Exit.]

ROSENCRANTZ.

Will’t please you go, my lord?



HAMLET.

I’ll be with you straight. Go a little before.



[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]

How all occasions do inform against me,

And spur my dull revenge. What is a man

If his chief good and market of his time

Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.

Sure he that made us with such large discourse,

Looking before and after, gave us not

That capability and godlike reason

To fust in us unus’d. Now whether it be

Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple

Of thinking too precisely on th’event,—

A thought which, quarter’d, hath but one part wisdom

And ever three parts coward,—I do not know

Why yet I live to say this thing’s to do,

Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means

To do’t. Examples gross as earth exhort me,

Witness this army of such mass and charge,

Led by a delicate and tender prince,

Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff’d,

Makes mouths at the invisible event,

Exposing what is mortal and unsure

To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,

Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be great

Is not to stir without great argument,

But greatly to find quarrel in a straw

When honour’s at the stake. How stand I then,

That have a father kill’d, a mother stain’d,

Excitements of my reason and my blood,

And let all sleep, while to my shame I see

The imminent death of twenty thousand men

That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,

Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot

Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,

Which is not tomb enough and continent

To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,

My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.



[Exit.]





SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.


Enter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman.

QUEEN.

I will not speak with her.



GENTLEMAN.

She is importunate, indeed distract.

Her mood will needs be pitied.



QUEEN.

What would she have?



GENTLEMAN.

She speaks much of her father; says she hears

There’s tricks i’ th’ world, and hems, and beats her heart,

Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt,

That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,

Yet the unshaped use of it doth move

The hearers to collection; they aim at it,

And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,

Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,

Indeed would make one think there might be thought,

Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

’Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strew

Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.



QUEEN.

Let her come in.



[Exit Gentleman.]

To my sick soul, as sin’s true nature is,

Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.

So full of artless jealousy is guilt,

It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.



Enter Ophelia.

OPHELIA.

Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?



QUEEN.

How now, Ophelia?



OPHELIA.

[Sings.]

How should I your true love know

From another one?

By his cockle bat and staff

And his sandal shoon.



QUEEN.

Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?



OPHELIA.

Say you? Nay, pray you mark.

[Sings.]

He is dead and gone, lady,

He is dead and gone,

At his head a grass green turf,

At his heels a stone.



QUEEN.

Nay, but Ophelia—



OPHELIA.

Pray you mark.

[Sings.]

White his shroud as the mountain snow.



Enter King.

QUEEN.

Alas, look here, my lord!



OPHELIA.

[Sings.]

Larded all with sweet flowers;

Which bewept to the grave did go

With true-love showers.



KING.

How do you, pretty lady?



OPHELIA.

Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker’s daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!

KING.

Conceit upon her father.



OPHELIA.

Pray you, let’s have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:

[Sings.]

Tomorrow is Saint Valentine’s day,

All in the morning betime,

And I a maid at your window,

To be your Valentine.



Then up he rose and donn’d his clothes,

And dupp’d the chamber door,

Let in the maid, that out a maid

Never departed more.



KING.

Pretty Ophelia!



OPHELIA.

Indeed la, without an oath, I’ll make an end on’t.

[Sings.]

By Gis and by Saint Charity,

Alack, and fie for shame!

Young men will do’t if they come to’t;

By Cock, they are to blame.



Quoth she, before you tumbled me,

You promis’d me to wed.

So would I ha’ done, by yonder sun,

An thou hadst not come to my bed.



KING.

How long hath she been thus?



OPHELIA.

I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him i’ th’ cold ground. My brother shall know of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.

[Exit.]

KING.

Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.



[Exit Horatio.]

O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs

All from her father’s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,

When sorrows come, they come not single spies,

But in battalions. First, her father slain;

Next, your son gone; and he most violent author

Of his own just remove; the people muddied,

Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers

For good Polonius’ death; and we have done but greenly

In hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor Ophelia

Divided from herself and her fair judgment,

Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts.

Last, and as much containing as all these,

Her brother is in secret come from France,

Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,

And wants not buzzers to infect his ear

With pestilent speeches of his father’s death,

Wherein necessity, of matter beggar’d,

Will nothing stick our person to arraign

In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,

Like to a murdering piece, in many places

Gives me superfluous death.



[A noise within.]

QUEEN.

Alack, what noise is this?



KING.

Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

Enter a Gentleman.

What is the matter?

GENTLEMAN.

Save yourself, my lord.

The ocean, overpeering of his list,

Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste

Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,

O’erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,

And, as the world were now but to begin,

Antiquity forgot, custom not known,

The ratifiers and props of every word,

They cry ‘Choose we! Laertes shall be king!’

Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,

‘Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.’



QUEEN.

How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.

O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.



[A noise within.]

KING.

The doors are broke.



Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.

LAERTES.

Where is this king?—Sirs, stand you all without.



Danes.

No, let’s come in.



LAERTES.

I pray you, give me leave.



DANES.

We will, we will.



[They retire without the door.]

LAERTES.

I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,

Give me my father.



QUEEN.

Calmly, good Laertes.



LAERTES.

That drop of blood that’s calm proclaims me bastard;

Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot

Even here between the chaste unsmirched brow

Of my true mother.



KING.

What is the cause, Laertes,

That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?—

Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.

There’s such divinity doth hedge a king,

That treason can but peep to what it would,

Acts little of his will.—Tell me, Laertes,

Why thou art thus incens’d.—Let him go, Gertrude:—

Speak, man.



LAERTES.

Where is my father?



KING.

Dead.



QUEEN.

But not by him.



KING.

Let him demand his fill.



LAERTES.

How came he dead? I’ll not be juggled with.

To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!

Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!

I dare damnation. To this point I stand,

That both the worlds, I give to negligence,

Let come what comes; only I’ll be reveng’d

Most throughly for my father.



KING.

Who shall stay you?



LAERTES.

My will, not all the world.

And for my means, I’ll husband them so well,

They shall go far with little.



KING.

Good Laertes,

If you desire to know the certainty

Of your dear father’s death, is’t writ in your revenge

That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,

Winner and loser?



LAERTES.

None but his enemies.



KING.

Will you know them then?



LAERTES.

To his good friends thus wide I’ll ope my arms;

And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,

Repast them with my blood.



KING.

Why, now you speak

Like a good child and a true gentleman.

That I am guiltless of your father’s death,

And am most sensibly in grief for it,

It shall as level to your judgment ’pear

As day does to your eye.



DANES.

[Within.] Let her come in.



LAERTES.

How now! What noise is that?



Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.

O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,

Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.

By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,

Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!

Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!

O heavens, is’t possible a young maid’s wits

Should be as mortal as an old man’s life?

Nature is fine in love, and where ’tis fine,

It sends some precious instance of itself

After the thing it loves.



OPHELIA.

[Sings.]

They bore him barefac’d on the bier,

Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny

And on his grave rain’d many a tear.—

Fare you well, my dove!

LAERTES.

Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,

It could not move thus.



OPHELIA.

You must sing ‘Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.’ O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master’s daughter.

LAERTES.

This nothing’s more than matter.



OPHELIA.

There’s rosemary, that’s for remembrance; pray love, remember. And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts.

LAERTES.

A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.



OPHELIA.

There’s fennel for you, and columbines. There’s rue for you; and here’s some for me. We may call it herb of grace o’ Sundays. O you must wear your rue with a difference. There’s a daisy. I would give you some violets, but they wither’d all when my father died. They say he made a good end.

[Sings.]

For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

LAERTES.

Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself

She turns to favour and to prettiness.



OPHELIA.

[Sings.]

And will he not come again?

And will he not come again?

No, no, he is dead,

Go to thy death-bed,

He never will come again.



His beard was as white as snow,

All flaxen was his poll.

He is gone, he is gone,

And we cast away moan.

God ha’ mercy on his soul.



And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b’ wi’ ye.

[Exit.]

LAERTES.

Do you see this, O God?



KING.

Laertes, I must commune with your grief,

Or you deny me right. Go but apart,

Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,

And they shall hear and judge ’twixt you and me.

If by direct or by collateral hand

They find us touch’d, we will our kingdom give,

Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours

To you in satisfaction; but if not,

Be you content to lend your patience to us,

And we shall jointly labour with your soul

To give it due content.



LAERTES.

Let this be so;

His means of death, his obscure burial,—

No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o’er his bones,

No noble rite, nor formal ostentation,—

Cry to be heard, as ’twere from heaven to earth,

That I must call’t in question.



KING.

So you shall.

And where th’offence is let the great axe fall.

I pray you go with me.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE VI. Another room in the Castle.


Enter Horatio and a Servant.

HORATIO.

What are they that would speak with me?



SERVANT.

Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.



HORATIO.

Let them come in.



[Exit Servant.]

I do not know from what part of the world

I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.



Enter Sailors.

FIRST SAILOR.

God bless you, sir.



HORATIO.

Let him bless thee too.



FIRST SAILOR.

He shall, sir, and’t please him. There’s a letter for you, sir. It comes from th’ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.

HORATIO.

[Reads.] ‘Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they got clear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, and repair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.

He that thou knowest thine,

HAMLET.’

Come, I will give you way for these your letters,

And do’t the speedier, that you may direct me

To him from whom you brought them.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.


Enter King and Laertes.

KING.

Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,

And you must put me in your heart for friend,

Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,

That he which hath your noble father slain

Pursu’d my life.



LAERTES.

It well appears. But tell me

Why you proceeded not against these feats,

So crimeful and so capital in nature,

As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,

You mainly were stirr’d up.



KING.

O, for two special reasons,

Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew’d,

But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother

Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,—

My virtue or my plague, be it either which,—

She’s so conjunctive to my life and soul,

That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,

I could not but by her. The other motive,

Why to a public count I might not go,

Is the great love the general gender bear him,

Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,

Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone,

Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,

Too slightly timber’d for so loud a wind,

Would have reverted to my bow again,

And not where I had aim’d them.



LAERTES.

And so have I a noble father lost,

A sister driven into desperate terms,

Whose worth, if praises may go back again,

Stood challenger on mount of all the age

For her perfections. But my revenge will come.



KING.

Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think

That we are made of stuff so flat and dull

That we can let our beard be shook with danger,

And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.

I lov’d your father, and we love ourself,

And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine—



Enter a Messenger.

How now? What news?

MESSENGER.

Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.

This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.



KING.

From Hamlet! Who brought them?



MESSENGER.

Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.

They were given me by Claudio. He receiv’d them

Of him that brought them.



KING.

Laertes, you shall hear them.

Leave us.



[Exit Messenger.]

[Reads.] ‘High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my sudden and more strange return.

HAMLET.’

What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?

Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?



LAERTES.

Know you the hand?



KING.

’Tis Hamlet’s character. ’Naked!’

And in a postscript here he says ‘alone.’

Can you advise me?



LAERTES.

I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,

It warms the very sickness in my heart

That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,

‘Thus diest thou.’



KING.

If it be so, Laertes,—

As how should it be so? How otherwise?—

Will you be rul’d by me?



LAERTES.

Ay, my lord;

So you will not o’errule me to a peace.



KING.

To thine own peace. If he be now return’d,

As checking at his voyage, and that he means

No more to undertake it, I will work him

To exploit, now ripe in my device,

Under the which he shall not choose but fall;

And for his death no wind shall breathe,

But even his mother shall uncharge the practice

And call it accident.



LAERTES.

My lord, I will be rul’d;

The rather if you could devise it so

That I might be the organ.



KING.

It falls right.

You have been talk’d of since your travel much,

And that in Hamlet’s hearing, for a quality

Wherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts

Did not together pluck such envy from him

As did that one, and that, in my regard,

Of the unworthiest siege.



LAERTES.

What part is that, my lord?



KING.

A very riband in the cap of youth,

Yet needful too, for youth no less becomes

The light and careless livery that it wears

Than settled age his sables and his weeds,

Importing health and graveness. Two months since

Here was a gentleman of Normandy,—

I’ve seen myself, and serv’d against, the French,

And they can well on horseback, but this gallant

Had witchcraft in’t. He grew unto his seat,

And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,

As had he been incorps’d and demi-natur’d

With the brave beast. So far he topp’d my thought

That I in forgery of shapes and tricks,

Come short of what he did.



LAERTES.

A Norman was’t?



KING.

A Norman.



LAERTES.

Upon my life, Lamond.



KING.

The very same.



LAERTES.

I know him well. He is the brooch indeed

And gem of all the nation.



KING.

He made confession of you,

And gave you such a masterly report

For art and exercise in your defence,

And for your rapier most especially,

That he cried out ’twould be a sight indeed

If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation

He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,

If you oppos’d them. Sir, this report of his

Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy

That he could nothing do but wish and beg

Your sudden coming o’er to play with him.

Now, out of this,—



LAERTES.

What out of this, my lord?



KING.

Laertes, was your father dear to you?

Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,

A face without a heart?



LAERTES.

Why ask you this?



KING.

Not that I think you did not love your father,

But that I know love is begun by time,

And that I see, in passages of proof,

Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.

There lives within the very flame of love

A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;

And nothing is at a like goodness still,

For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,

Dies in his own too much. That we would do,

We should do when we would; for this ‘would’ changes,

And hath abatements and delays as many

As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;

And then this ‘should’ is like a spendthrift sigh

That hurts by easing. But to the quick o’ th’ulcer:

Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake

To show yourself your father’s son in deed,

More than in words?



LAERTES.

To cut his throat i’ th’ church.



KING.

No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;

Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,

Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.

Hamlet return’d shall know you are come home:

We’ll put on those shall praise your excellence,

And set a double varnish on the fame

The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together

And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,

Most generous, and free from all contriving,

Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,

Or with a little shuffling, you may choose

A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,

Requite him for your father.



LAERTES.

I will do’t.

And for that purpose I’ll anoint my sword.

I bought an unction of a mountebank

So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,

Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,

Collected from all simples that have virtue

Under the moon, can save the thing from death

This is but scratch’d withal. I’ll touch my point

With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,

It may be death.



KING.

Let’s further think of this,

Weigh what convenience both of time and means

May fit us to our shape. If this should fail,

And that our drift look through our bad performance.

’Twere better not assay’d. Therefore this project

Should have a back or second, that might hold

If this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.

We’ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,—

I ha’t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,

As make your bouts more violent to that end,

And that he calls for drink, I’ll have prepar’d him

A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,

If he by chance escape your venom’d stuck,

Our purpose may hold there.



Enter Queen.

How now, sweet Queen?

QUEEN.

One woe doth tread upon another’s heel,

So fast they follow. Your sister’s drown’d, Laertes.



LAERTES.

Drown’d! O, where?



QUEEN.

There is a willow grows aslant a brook,

That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.

There with fantastic garlands did she make

Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,

That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,

But our cold maids do dead men’s fingers call them.

There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds

Clamb’ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,

When down her weedy trophies and herself

Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,

And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,

Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,

As one incapable of her own distress,

Or like a creature native and indued

Unto that element. But long it could not be

Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,

Pull’d the poor wretch from her melodious lay

To muddy death.



LAERTES.

Alas, then she is drown’d?



QUEEN.

Drown’d, drown’d.



LAERTES.

Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,

And therefore I forbid my tears. But yet

It is our trick; nature her custom holds,

Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,

The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,

I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,

But that this folly douts it.



[Exit.]

KING.

Let’s follow, Gertrude;

How much I had to do to calm his rage!

Now fear I this will give it start again;

Therefore let’s follow.



[Exeunt.]





ACT V


SCENE I. A churchyard.


Enter two Clowns with spades, &c.

FIRST CLOWN.

Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?

SECOND CLOWN.

I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.

FIRST CLOWN.

How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?

SECOND CLOWN.

Why, ’tis found so.

FIRST CLOWN.

It must be se offendendo, it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.

SECOND CLOWN.

Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,—

FIRST CLOWN.

Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If the man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he goes,—mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.

SECOND CLOWN.

But is this law?

FIRST CLOWN.

Ay, marry, is’t, crowner’s quest law.

SECOND CLOWN.

Will you ha’ the truth on’t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o’ Christian burial.

FIRST CLOWN.

Why, there thou say’st. And the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their even Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam’s profession.

SECOND CLOWN.

Was he a gentleman?

FIRST CLOWN.

He was the first that ever bore arms.

SECOND CLOWN.

Why, he had none.

FIRST CLOWN.

What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says Adam digg’d. Could he dig without arms? I’ll put another question to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself—

SECOND CLOWN.

Go to.

FIRST CLOWN.

What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

SECOND CLOWN.

The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.

FIRST CLOWN.

I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To’t again, come.

SECOND CLOWN.

Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?

FIRST CLOWN.

Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

SECOND CLOWN.

Marry, now I can tell.

FIRST CLOWN.

To’t.

SECOND CLOWN.

Mass, I cannot tell.

Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.

FIRST CLOWN.

Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say ‘a grave-maker’. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.

[Exit Second Clown.]

[Digs and sings.]

In youth when I did love, did love,

Methought it was very sweet;

To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,

O methought there was nothing meet.



HAMLET.

Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at grave-making?

HORATIO.

Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.



HAMLET.

’Tis e’en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.

FIRST CLOWN.

[Sings.]

But age with his stealing steps

Hath claw’d me in his clutch,

And hath shipp’d me into the land,

As if I had never been such.



[Throws up a skull.]

HAMLET.

That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls it to th’ ground, as if ’twere Cain’s jawbone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now o’er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?

HORATIO.

It might, my lord.



HAMLET.

Or of a courtier, which could say ‘Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?’ This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one’s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?

HORATIO.

Ay, my lord.



HAMLET.

Why, e’en so: and now my Lady Worm’s; chapless, and knocked about the mazard with a sexton’s spade. Here’s fine revolution, an we had the trick to see’t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play at loggets with ’em? Mine ache to think on’t.

FIRST CLOWN.

[Sings.]

A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,

For and a shrouding-sheet;

O, a pit of clay for to be made

For such a guest is meet.



[Throws up another skull.]

HAMLET.

There’s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum. This fellow might be in’s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?

HORATIO.

Not a jot more, my lord.



HAMLET.

Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?



HORATIO.

Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.



HAMLET.

They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow.—Whose grave’s this, sir?

FIRST CLOWN.

Mine, sir.

[Sings.]

O, a pit of clay for to be made

For such a guest is meet.



HAMLET.

I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in’t.



FIRST CLOWN.

You lie out on’t, sir, and therefore ’tis not yours.

For my part, I do not lie in’t, yet it is mine.



HAMLET.

Thou dost lie in’t, to be in’t and say it is thine. ’Tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

FIRST CLOWN.

’Tis a quick lie, sir; ’t will away again from me to you.

HAMLET.

What man dost thou dig it for?



FIRST CLOWN.

For no man, sir.

HAMLET.

What woman then?



FIRST CLOWN.

For none neither.

HAMLET.

Who is to be buried in’t?



FIRST CLOWN.

One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she’s dead.

HAMLET.

How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.—How long hast thou been a grave-maker?

FIRST CLOWN.

Of all the days i’ th’ year, I came to’t that day that our last King Hamlet o’ercame Fortinbras.

HAMLET.

How long is that since?



FIRST CLOWN.

Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day that young Hamlet was born,—he that is mad, and sent into England.

HAMLET.

Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?



FIRST CLOWN.

Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do not, it’s no great matter there.

HAMLET.

Why?



FIRST CLOWN.

’Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.

HAMLET.

How came he mad?



FIRST CLOWN.

Very strangely, they say.

HAMLET.

How strangely?



FIRST CLOWN.

Faith, e’en with losing his wits.

HAMLET.

Upon what ground?



FIRST CLOWN.

Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.

HAMLET.

How long will a man lie i’ th’earth ere he rot?



FIRST CLOWN.

Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,—as we have many pocky corses nowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,—he will last you some eight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.

HAMLET.

Why he more than another?



FIRST CLOWN.

Why, sir, his hide is so tann’d with his trade that he will keep out water a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here’s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth three-and-twenty years.

HAMLET.

Whose was it?



FIRST CLOWN.

A whoreson, mad fellow’s it was. Whose do you think it was?

HAMLET.

Nay, I know not.



FIRST CLOWN.

A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour’d a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick’s skull, the King’s jester.

HAMLET.

This?



FIRST CLOWN.

E’en that.

HAMLET.

Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kiss’d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen? Now get you to my lady’s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.—Prythee, Horatio, tell me one thing.

HORATIO.

What’s that, my lord?



HAMLET.

Dost thou think Alexander looked o’ this fashion i’ th’earth?



HORATIO.

E’en so.



HAMLET.

And smelt so? Pah!



[Throws down the skull.]

HORATIO.

E’en so, my lord.



HAMLET.

To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

HORATIO.

’Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.



HAMLET.

No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?

Imperious Caesar, dead and turn’d to clay,

Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.

O, that that earth which kept the world in awe

Should patch a wall t’expel the winter’s flaw.

But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.



Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.

The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?

And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken

The corse they follow did with desperate hand

Fordo it own life. ’Twas of some estate.

Couch we awhile and mark.



[Retiring with Horatio.]

LAERTES.

What ceremony else?



HAMLET.

That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.

LAERTES.

What ceremony else?



PRIEST.

Her obsequies have been as far enlarg’d

As we have warranties. Her death was doubtful;

And but that great command o’ersways the order,

She should in ground unsanctified have lodg’d

Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,

Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.

Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,

Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home

Of bell and burial.



LAERTES.

Must there no more be done?



PRIEST.

No more be done.

We should profane the service of the dead

To sing sage requiem and such rest to her

As to peace-parted souls.



LAERTES.

Lay her i’ th’earth,

And from her fair and unpolluted flesh

May violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,

A minist’ring angel shall my sister be

When thou liest howling.



HAMLET.

What, the fair Ophelia?



QUEEN.

[Scattering flowers.] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.

I hop’d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet’s wife;

I thought thy bride-bed to have deck’d, sweet maid,

And not have strew’d thy grave.



LAERTES.

O, treble woe

Fall ten times treble on that cursed head

Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense

Depriv’d thee of. Hold off the earth a while,

Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.

[Leaps into the grave.]

Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,

Till of this flat a mountain you have made,

To o’ertop old Pelion or the skyish head

Of blue Olympus.



HAMLET.

[Advancing.]

What is he whose grief

Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow

Conjures the wand’ring stars, and makes them stand

Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,

Hamlet the Dane.

[Leaps into the grave.]



LAERTES.

[Grappling with him.] The devil take thy soul!

HAMLET.

Thou pray’st not well.

I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;

For though I am not splenative and rash,

Yet have I in me something dangerous,

Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!



KING.

Pluck them asunder.



QUEEN.

Hamlet! Hamlet!



All.

Gentlemen!



HORATIO.

Good my lord, be quiet.



[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]

HAMLET.

Why, I will fight with him upon this theme

Until my eyelids will no longer wag.



QUEEN.

O my son, what theme?



HAMLET.

I lov’d Ophelia; forty thousand brothers

Could not, with all their quantity of love,

Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?



KING.

O, he is mad, Laertes.



QUEEN.

For love of God forbear him!



HAMLET.

’Swounds, show me what thou’lt do:

Woul’t weep? woul’t fight? woul’t fast? woul’t tear thyself?

Woul’t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?

I’ll do’t. Dost thou come here to whine?

To outface me with leaping in her grave?

Be buried quick with her, and so will I.

And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw

Millions of acres on us, till our ground,

Singeing his pate against the burning zone,

Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou’lt mouth,

I’ll rant as well as thou.



QUEEN.

This is mere madness:

And thus awhile the fit will work on him;

Anon, as patient as the female dove,

When that her golden couplets are disclos’d,

His silence will sit drooping.



HAMLET.

Hear you, sir;

What is the reason that you use me thus?

I lov’d you ever. But it is no matter.

Let Hercules himself do what he may,

The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.



[Exit.]

KING.

I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.



[Exit Horatio.]

[To Laertes]

Strengthen your patience in our last night’s speech;

We’ll put the matter to the present push.—

Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.

This grave shall have a living monument.

An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;

Till then in patience our proceeding be.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.


Enter Hamlet and Horatio.

HAMLET.

So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;

You do remember all the circumstance?



HORATIO.

Remember it, my lord!



HAMLET.

Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting

That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay

Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,

And prais’d be rashness for it,—let us know,

Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,

When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us

There’s a divinity that shapes our ends,

Rough-hew them how we will.



HORATIO.

That is most certain.



HAMLET.

Up from my cabin,

My sea-gown scarf’d about me, in the dark

Grop’d I to find out them; had my desire,

Finger’d their packet, and in fine, withdrew

To mine own room again, making so bold,

My fears forgetting manners, to unseal

Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,

Oh royal knavery! an exact command,

Larded with many several sorts of reasons,

Importing Denmark’s health, and England’s too,

With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,

That on the supervise, no leisure bated,

No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,

My head should be struck off.



HORATIO.

Is’t possible?



HAMLET.

Here’s the commission, read it at more leisure.

But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?



HORATIO.

I beseech you.



HAMLET.

Being thus benetted round with villanies,—

Or I could make a prologue to my brains,

They had begun the play,—I sat me down,

Devis’d a new commission, wrote it fair:

I once did hold it, as our statists do,

A baseness to write fair, and labour’d much

How to forget that learning; but, sir, now

It did me yeoman’s service. Wilt thou know

The effect of what I wrote?



HORATIO.

Ay, good my lord.



HAMLET.

An earnest conjuration from the King,

As England was his faithful tributary,

As love between them like the palm might flourish,

As peace should still her wheaten garland wear

And stand a comma ’tween their amities,

And many such-like ‘as’es of great charge,

That on the view and know of these contents,

Without debatement further, more or less,

He should the bearers put to sudden death,

Not shriving-time allow’d.



HORATIO.

How was this seal’d?



HAMLET.

Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.

I had my father’s signet in my purse,

Which was the model of that Danish seal:

Folded the writ up in the form of the other,

Subscrib’d it: gave’t th’impression; plac’d it safely,

The changeling never known. Now, the next day

Was our sea-fight, and what to this was sequent

Thou know’st already.



HORATIO.

So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to’t.



HAMLET.

Why, man, they did make love to this employment.

They are not near my conscience; their defeat

Does by their own insinuation grow.

’Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes

Between the pass and fell incensed points

Of mighty opposites.



HORATIO.

Why, what a king is this!



HAMLET.

Does it not, thinks’t thee, stand me now upon,—

He that hath kill’d my king, and whor’d my mother,

Popp’d in between th’election and my hopes,

Thrown out his angle for my proper life,

And with such cozenage—is’t not perfect conscience

To quit him with this arm? And is’t not to be damn’d

To let this canker of our nature come

In further evil?



HORATIO.

It must be shortly known to him from England

What is the issue of the business there.



HAMLET.

It will be short. The interim is mine;

And a man’s life’s no more than to say ‘One’.

But I am very sorry, good Horatio,

That to Laertes I forgot myself;

For by the image of my cause I see

The portraiture of his. I’ll court his favours.

But sure the bravery of his grief did put me

Into a tow’ring passion.



HORATIO.

Peace, who comes here?



Enter Osric.

OSRIC.

Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.



HAMLET.

I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?



HORATIO.

No, my good lord.



HAMLET.

Thy state is the more gracious; for ’tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king’s mess; ’tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.

OSRIC.

Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his Majesty.

HAMLET.

I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; ’tis for the head.

OSRIC.

I thank your lordship, ’tis very hot.



HAMLET.

No, believe me, ’tis very cold, the wind is northerly.



OSRIC.

It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.



HAMLET.

Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.



OSRIC.

Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,—as ’twere—I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter,—

HAMLET.

I beseech you, remember,—

[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]

OSRIC.

Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.

HAMLET.

Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy th’arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.

OSRIC.

Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.



HAMLET.

The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?

OSRIC.

Sir?



HORATIO.

Is’t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do’t, sir, really.

HAMLET.

What imports the nomination of this gentleman?



OSRIC.

Of Laertes?



HORATIO.

His purse is empty already, all’s golden words are spent.



HAMLET.

Of him, sir.



OSRIC.

I know you are not ignorant,—



HAMLET.

I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

OSRIC.

You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,—



HAMLET.

I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.

OSRIC.

I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by them in his meed he’s unfellowed.

HAMLET.

What’s his weapon?



OSRIC.

Rapier and dagger.



HAMLET.

That’s two of his weapons. But well.



OSRIC.

The King, sir, hath wager’d with him six Barbary horses, against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.

HAMLET.

What call you the carriages?



HORATIO.

I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.



OSRIC.

The carriages, sir, are the hangers.



HAMLET.

The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that’s the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all imponed, as you call it?

OSRIC.

The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, he shall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. And it would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.

HAMLET.

How if I answer no?



OSRIC.

I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.



HAMLET.

Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

OSRIC.

Shall I re-deliver you e’en so?



HAMLET.

To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.



OSRIC.

I commend my duty to your lordship.



HAMLET.

Yours, yours.



[Exit Osric.]

He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for’s turn.

HORATIO.

This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.



HAMLET.

He did comply with his dug before he suck’d it. Thus has he,—and many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,— only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeasty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out,

Enter a Lord.

LORD.

My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.

HAMLET.

I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King’s pleasure. If his fitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.

LORD.

The King and Queen and all are coming down.



HAMLET.

In happy time.



LORD.

The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

HAMLET.

She well instructs me.



[Exit Lord.]

HORATIO.

You will lose this wager, my lord.



HAMLET.

I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continual practice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all’s here about my heart: but it is no matter.

HORATIO.

Nay, good my lord.



HAMLET.

It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.

HORATIO.

If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.

HAMLET.

Not a whit, we defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, ’tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is’t to leave betimes?

Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils &c.

KING.

Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.



[The King puts Laertes’s hand into Hamlet’s.]

HAMLET.

Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;

But pardon’t as you are a gentleman.

This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,

How I am punish’d with sore distraction.

What I have done

That might your nature, honour, and exception

Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.

Was’t Hamlet wrong’d Laertes? Never Hamlet.

If Hamlet from himself be ta’en away,

And when he’s not himself does wrong Laertes,

Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.

Who does it, then? His madness. If’t be so,

Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong’d;

His madness is poor Hamlet’s enemy.

Sir, in this audience,

Let my disclaiming from a purpos’d evil

Free me so far in your most generous thoughts

That I have shot my arrow o’er the house

And hurt my brother.



LAERTES.

I am satisfied in nature,

Whose motive in this case should stir me most

To my revenge. But in my terms of honour

I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement

Till by some elder masters of known honour

I have a voice and precedent of peace

To keep my name ungor’d. But till that time

I do receive your offer’d love like love,

And will not wrong it.



HAMLET.

I embrace it freely,

And will this brother’s wager frankly play.—

Give us the foils; come on.



LAERTES.

Come, one for me.



HAMLET.

I’ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance

Your skill shall like a star i’ th’ darkest night,

Stick fiery off indeed.



LAERTES.

You mock me, sir.



HAMLET.

No, by this hand.



KING.

Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,

You know the wager?



HAMLET.

Very well, my lord.

Your Grace has laid the odds o’ the weaker side.



KING.

I do not fear it. I have seen you both;

But since he is better’d, we have therefore odds.



LAERTES.

This is too heavy. Let me see another.



HAMLET.

This likes me well. These foils have all a length?



[They prepare to play.]

OSRIC.

Ay, my good lord.



KING.

Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.

If Hamlet give the first or second hit,

Or quit in answer of the third exchange,

Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;

The King shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath,

And in the cup an union shall he throw

Richer than that which four successive kings

In Denmark’s crown have worn. Give me the cups;

And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,

The trumpet to the cannoneer without,

The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,

‘Now the King drinks to Hamlet.’ Come, begin.

And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.



HAMLET.

Come on, sir.



LAERTES.

Come, my lord.



[They play.]

HAMLET.

One.



LAERTES.

No.



HAMLET.

Judgment.



OSRIC.

A hit, a very palpable hit.



LAERTES.

Well; again.



KING.

Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;

Here’s to thy health.



[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]

Give him the cup.

HAMLET.

I’ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.

[They play.]

Come. Another hit; what say you?



LAERTES.

A touch, a touch, I do confess.



KING.

Our son shall win.



QUEEN.

He’s fat, and scant of breath.

Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.

The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.



HAMLET.

Good madam.



KING.

Gertrude, do not drink.



QUEEN.

I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.



KING.

[Aside.] It is the poison’d cup; it is too late.



HAMLET.

I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.



QUEEN.

Come, let me wipe thy face.



LAERTES.

My lord, I’ll hit him now.



KING.

I do not think’t.



LAERTES.

[Aside.] And yet ’tis almost ’gainst my conscience.



HAMLET.

Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.

I pray you pass with your best violence.

I am afeard you make a wanton of me.



LAERTES.

Say you so? Come on.



[They play.]

OSRIC.

Nothing neither way.



LAERTES.

Have at you now.



[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]

KING.

Part them; they are incens’d.



HAMLET.

Nay, come again!



[The Queen falls.]

OSRIC.

Look to the Queen there, ho!



HORATIO.

They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?



OSRIC.

How is’t, Laertes?



LAERTES.

Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.

I am justly kill’d with mine own treachery.



HAMLET.

How does the Queen?



KING.

She swoons to see them bleed.



QUEEN.

No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!

The drink, the drink! I am poison’d.



[Dies.]

HAMLET.

O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock’d:

Treachery! Seek it out.



[Laertes falls.]

LAERTES.

It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.

No medicine in the world can do thee good.

In thee there is not half an hour of life;

The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,

Unbated and envenom’d. The foul practice

Hath turn’d itself on me. Lo, here I lie,

Never to rise again. Thy mother’s poison’d.

I can no more. The King, the King’s to blame.



HAMLET.

The point envenom’d too!

Then, venom, to thy work.



[Stabs the King.]

OSRIC and LORDS.

Treason! treason!



KING.

O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.



HAMLET.

Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,

Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?

Follow my mother.



[King dies.]

LAERTES.

He is justly serv’d.

It is a poison temper’d by himself.

Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.

Mine and my father’s death come not upon thee,

Nor thine on me.



[Dies.]

HAMLET.

Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.

I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.

You that look pale and tremble at this chance,

That are but mutes or audience to this act,

Had I but time,—as this fell sergeant, death,

Is strict in his arrest,—O, I could tell you,—

But let it be. Horatio, I am dead,

Thou liv’st; report me and my cause aright

To the unsatisfied.



HORATIO.

Never believe it.

I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.

Here’s yet some liquor left.



HAMLET.

As th’art a man,

Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I’ll have’t.

O good Horatio, what a wounded name,

Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.

If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,

Absent thee from felicity awhile,

And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,

To tell my story.



[March afar off, and shot within.]

What warlike noise is this?

OSRIC.

Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,

To the ambassadors of England gives

This warlike volley.



HAMLET.

O, I die, Horatio.

The potent poison quite o’er-crows my spirit:

I cannot live to hear the news from England,

But I do prophesy th’election lights

On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.

So tell him, with the occurrents more and less,

Which have solicited. The rest is silence.



[Dies.]

HORATIO.

Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,

And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.

Why does the drum come hither?



[March within.]

Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.

FORTINBRAS.

Where is this sight?



HORATIO.

What is it you would see?

If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.



FORTINBRAS.

This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,

What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,

That thou so many princes at a shot

So bloodily hast struck?



FIRST AMBASSADOR.

The sight is dismal;

And our affairs from England come too late.

The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,

To tell him his commandment is fulfill’d,

That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

Where should we have our thanks?



HORATIO.

Not from his mouth,

Had it th’ability of life to thank you.

He never gave commandment for their death.

But since, so jump upon this bloody question,

You from the Polack wars, and you from England

Are here arriv’d, give order that these bodies

High on a stage be placed to the view,

And let me speak to th’ yet unknowing world

How these things came about. So shall you hear

Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,

Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,

Of deaths put on by cunning and forc’d cause,

And, in this upshot, purposes mistook

Fall’n on the inventors’ heads. All this can I

Truly deliver.



FORTINBRAS.

Let us haste to hear it,

And call the noblest to the audience.

For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.

I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,

Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.



HORATIO.

Of that I shall have also cause to speak,

And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.

But let this same be presently perform’d,

Even while men’s minds are wild, lest more mischance

On plots and errors happen.



FORTINBRAS.

Let four captains

Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,

For he was likely, had he been put on,

To have prov’d most royally; and for his passage,

The soldiers’ music and the rites of war

Speak loudly for him.

Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this

Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.

Go, bid the soldiers shoot.



[A dead march.]

[Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance is shot off.]

SCENE. England and Wales.


ACT I


SCENE I. London. A Room in the Palace.


[Enter the King Henry, Westmoreland, Sir Walter Blunt, and others.]

KING.

So shaken as we are, so wan with care,

Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,

And breathe short-winded accents of new broils

To be commenced in strands afar remote.

No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

Shall daub her lips with her own children’s blood;

No more shall trenching war channel her fields,

Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs

Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,

Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,

All of one nature, of one substance bred,

Did lately meet in the intestine shock

And furious close of civil butchery,

Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,

March all one way, and be no more opposed

Against acquaintance, kindred, and allies:

The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,

No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,

As far as to the sepulchre of Christ—

Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross

We are impressed and engaged to fight—

Forthwith a power of English shall we levy,

To chase these pagans in those holy fields

Over whose acres walk’d those blessed feet

Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail’d

For our advantage on the bitter cross.

But this our purpose now is twelvemonth old,

And bootless ’tis to tell you we will go:

Therefore we meet not now.—Then let me hear

Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,

What yesternight our Council did decree

In forwarding this dear expedience.



WESTMORELAND.

My liege, this haste was hot in question,

And many limits of the charge set down

But yesternight; when, all athwart, there came

A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;

Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,

Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight

Against th’ irregular and wild Glendower,

Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken;

A thousand of his people butchered,

Upon whose dead corpse’ there was such misuse,

Such beastly, shameless transformation,

By those Welshwomen done, as may not be

Without much shame re-told or spoken of.



KING.

It seems, then, that the tidings of this broil

Brake off our business for the Holy Land.



WESTMORELAND.

This, match’d with other, did, my gracious lord;

For more uneven and unwelcome news

Came from the North, and thus it did import:

On Holy-rood day the gallant Hotspur there,

Young Harry Percy, and brave Archibald,

That ever-valiant and approved Scot,

At Holmedon met;

Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,

As by discharge of their artillery,

And shape of likelihood, the news was told;

For he that brought them, in the very heat

And pride of their contention did take horse,

Uncertain of the issue any way.



KING.

Here is a dear and true-industrious friend,

Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse,

Stain’d with the variation of each soil

Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;

And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.

The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:

Ten thousand bold Scots, two-and-twenty knights,

Balk’d in their own blood, did Sir Walter see

On Holmedon’s plains: of prisoners, Hotspur took

Mordake the Earl of Fife and eldest son

To beaten Douglas; and the Earls of Athol,

Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith.

And is not this an honourable spoil,

A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?



WESTMORELAND.

Faith, ’tis a conquest for a prince to boast of.



KING.

Yea, there thou makest me sad, and makest me sin

In envy that my Lord Northumberland

Should be the father to so blest a son,—

A son who is the theme of honour’s tongue;

Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;

Who is sweet Fortune’s minion and her pride:

Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,

See riot and dishonour stain the brow

Of my young Harry. O, that it could be proved

That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged

In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,

And call’d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!

Then would I have his Harry, and he mine:

But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,

Of this young Percy’s pride? the prisoners,

Which he in this adventure hath surprised,

To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,

I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.



WESTMORELAND.

This is his uncle’s teaching, this is Worcester,

Malevolent to you in all aspects;

Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up

The crest of youth against your dignity.



KING.

But I have sent for him to answer this;

And for this cause awhile we must neglect

Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.

Cousin, on Wednesday next our Council we

Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:

But come yourself with speed to us again;

For more is to be said and to be done

Than out of anger can be uttered.



WESTMORELAND.

I will, my liege.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE II. The same. An Apartment of Prince Henry’s.


[Enter Prince Henry and Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.

Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?



PRINCE.

Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? unless hours were cups of sack, and minutes capons, and the blessed Sun himself a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.

FALSTAFF.

Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take purses go by the Moon and the seven stars, and not by Phoebus,—he, that wandering knight so fair. And I pr’ythee, sweet wag, when thou art king,—as, God save thy Grace—Majesty I should say, for grace thou wilt have none,—

PRINCE.

What, none?



FALSTAFF.

No, by my troth; not so much as will serve to be prologue to an egg and butter.

PRINCE.

Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.



FALSTAFF.

Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not us that are squires of the night’s body be called thieves of the day’s beauty: let us be Diana’s foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the Moon; and let men say we be men of good government, being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and chaste mistress the Moon, under whose countenance we steal.

PRINCE.

Thou say’st well, and it holds well too; for the fortune of us that are the Moon’s men doth ebb and flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, by the Moon. As, for proof, now: A purse of gold most resolutely snatch’d on Monday night, and most dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with swearing Lay by, and spent with crying Bring in; now ill as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder, and by-and-by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

FALSTAFF.

By the Lord, thou say’st true, lad. And is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?

PRINCE.

As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?

FALSTAFF.

How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a buff jerkin?

PRINCE.

Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?



FALSTAFF.

Well, thou hast call’d her to a reckoning many a time and oft.



PRINCE.

Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?



FALSTAFF.

No; I’ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.



PRINCE.

Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; and where it would not, I have used my credit.

FALSTAFF.

Yea, and so used it, that, were it not here apparent that thou art heir-apparent—But I pr’ythee, sweet wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when thou art king? and resolution thus fobb’d as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

PRINCE.

No; thou shalt.



FALSTAFF.

Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I’ll be a brave judge.



PRINCE.

Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves, and so become a rare hangman.

FALSTAFF.

Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my humour; as well as waiting in the Court, I can tell you.

PRINCE.

For obtaining of suits?



FALSTAFF.

Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe. ’Sblood, I am as melancholy as a gib-cat or a lugg’d bear.

PRINCE.

Or an old lion, or a lover’s lute.



FALSTAFF.

Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.



PRINCE.

What say’st thou to a hare, or the melancholy of Moor-ditch?



FALSTAFF.

Thou hast the most unsavoury similes, and art, indeed, the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young prince,—But, Hal, I pr’ythee trouble me no more with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought. An old lord of the Council rated me the other day in the street about you, sir,—but I mark’d him not; and yet he talk’d very wisely,—but I regarded him not; and yet he talk’d wisely, and in the street too.

PRINCE.

Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the streets, and no man regards it.

FALSTAFF.

O, thou hast damnable iteration, and art, indeed, able to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man should speak truly, little better than one of the wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give it over; by the Lord, an I do not, I am a villain: I’ll be damn’d for never a king’s son in Christendom.

PRINCE.

Where shall we take a purse to-morrow, Jack?



FALSTAFF.

Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I’ll make one: an I do not, call me villain, and baffle me.

PRINCE.

I see a good amendment of life in thee,—from praying to purse-taking.

FALSTAFF.

Why, Hal, ’tis my vocation, Hal; ’tis no sin for a man to labour in his vocation.

[Enter Poins.]

POINS.

Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what hole in Hell were hot enough for him? This is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried Stand! to a true man.

PRINCE.

Good morrow, Ned.



POINS.

Good morrow, sweet Hal.—What says Monsieur Remorse? what says Sir John Sack-and-sugar? Jack, how agrees the Devil and thee about thy soul, that thou soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira and a cold capon’s leg?

PRINCE.

Sir John stands to his word,—the Devil shall have his bargain;

for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs,—he will give the

Devil his due.



POINS.

Then art thou damn’d for keeping thy word with the Devil.



PRINCE.

Else he had been damn’d for cozening the Devil.



POINS.

But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four o’clock, early at Gads-hill! there are pilgrims gong to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders riding to London with fat purses: I have visards for you all; you have horses for yourselves: Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry at home and be hang’d.

FALSTAFF.

Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not, I’ll hang you for going.

POINS.

You will, chops?



FALSTAFF.

Hal, wilt thou make one?



PRINCE.

Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.



FALSTAFF.

There’s neither honesty, manhood, nor good fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.

PRINCE.

Well, then, once in my days I’ll be a madcap.



FALSTAFF.

Why, that’s well said.



PRINCE.

Well, come what will, I’ll tarry at home.



FALSTAFF.

By the Lord, I’ll be a traitor, then, when thou art king.



PRINCE.

I care not.



POINS.

Sir John, I pr’ythee, leave the Prince and me alone: I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure, that he shall go.

FALSTAFF.

Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion, and him the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may move, and what he hears may be believed, that the true Prince may, for recreation- sake, prove a false thief; for the poor abuses of the time want countenance. Farewell; you shall find me in Eastcheap.

PRINCE.

Farewell, thou latter Spring! farewell, All-hallown Summer!



[Exit Falstaff.]

POINS.

Now, my good sweet honey-lord, ride with us to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Gadshill, shall rob those men that we have already waylaid: yourself and I will not be there; and when they have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut this head off from my shoulders.

PRINCE.

But how shall we part with them in setting forth?



POINS.

Why, we will set forth before or after them, and appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at our pleasure to fail; and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have no sooner achieved but we’ll set upon them.

PRINCE.

Ay, but ’tis like that they will know us by our horses, by our habits, and by every other appointment, to be ourselves.

POINS.

Tut! our horses they shall not see,—I’ll tie them in the wood; our visards we will change, after we leave them; and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.

PRINCE.

But I doubt they will be too hard for us.



POINS.

Well, for two of them, I know them to be as true-bred cowards as ever turn’d back; and for the third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I’ll forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this lies the jest.

PRINCE.

Well, I’ll go with thee: provide us all things necessary and meet me to-night in Eastcheap; there I’ll sup. Farewell.

POINS.

Farewell, my lord.



[Exit.]

PRINCE.

I know you all, and will awhile uphold

The unyok’d humour of your idleness:

Yet herein will I imitate the Sun,

Who doth permit the base contagious clouds

To smother-up his beauty from the world,

That, when he please again to be himself,

Being wanted, he may be more wonder’d at,

By breaking through the foul and ugly mists

Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.

If all the year were playing holidays,

To sport would be as tedious as to work;

But, when they seldom come, they wish’d-for come,

And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.

So, when this loose behaviour I throw off,

And pay the debt I never promised,

By how much better than my word I am,

By so much shall I falsify men’s hopes;

And, like bright metal on a sullen ground,

My reformation, glittering o’er my fault,

Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes

Than that which hath no foil to set it off.

I’ll so offend, to make offence a skill;

Redeeming time, when men think least I will.



[Exit.]





SCENE III. The Same. A Room in the Palace.


[Enter King Henry, Northumberland, Worcester, Hotspur, Sir Walter

Blunt, and others.]



KING.

My blood hath been too cold and temperate,

Unapt to stir at these indignities,

And you have found me; for, accordingly,

You tread upon my patience: but be sure

I will from henceforth rather be myself,

Mighty and to be fear’d, than my condition,

Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,

And therefore lost that title of respect

Which the proud soul ne’er pays but to the proud.



WORCESTER.

Our House, my sovereign liege, little deserves

The scourge of greatness to be used on it;

And that same greatness too which our own hands

Have holp to make so portly.



NORTHUMBERLAND.

My good lord,—



KING.

Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see

Danger and disobedience in thine eye:

O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,

And majesty might never yet endure

The moody frontier of a servant brow.

You have good leave to leave us: when we need

Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.



[Exit Worcester.]

[To Northumberland.]

You were about to speak.

NORTHUMBERLAND.

Yea, my good lord.

Those prisoners in your Highness’ name demanded,

Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,

Were, as he says, not with such strength denied

As is deliver’d to your Majesty:

Either envy, therefore, or misprision

Is guilty of this fault, and not my son.



HOTSPUR.

My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

But, I remember, when the fight was done,

When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,

Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,

Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress’d,

Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap’d

Show’d like a stubble-land at harvest-home:

He was perfumed like a milliner;

And ’twixt his finger and his thumb he held

A pouncet-box, which ever and anon

He gave his nose, and took’t away again;

Who therewith angry, when it next came there,

Took it in snuff: and still he smiled and talk’d;

And, as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,

He call’d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,

To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse

Betwixt the wind and his nobility.

With many holiday and lady terms

He question’d me; amongst the rest, demanded

My prisoners in your Majesty’s behalf.

I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,

Out of my grief and my impatience

To be so pester’d with a popinjay,

Answer’d neglectingly, I know not what,—

He should, or he should not; for’t made me mad

To see him shine so brisk, and smell so sweet,

And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

Of guns and drums and wounds,—God save the mark!—

And telling me the sovereign’st thing on Earth

Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;

And that it was great pity, so it was,

This villainous salt-petre should be digg’d

Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,

Which many a good tall fellow had destroy’d

So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,

He would himself have been a soldier.

This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,

I answered indirectly, as I said;

And I beseech you, let not his report

Come current for an accusation

Betwixt my love and your high Majesty.



BLUNT.

The circumstance consider’d, good my lord,

Whatever Harry Percy then had said

To such a person, and in such a place,

At such a time, with all the rest re-told,

May reasonably die, and never rise

To do him wrong, or any way impeach

What then he said, so he unsay it now.



KING.

Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,

But with proviso and exception,

That we at our own charge shall ransom straight

His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;

Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray’d

The lives of those that he did lead to fight

Against that great magician, damn’d Glendower,

Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March

Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,

Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?

Shall we buy treason? and indent with fears

When they have lost and forfeited themselves?

No, on the barren mountains let him starve;

For I shall never hold that man my friend

Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost

To ransom home revolted Mortimer.



HOTSPUR.

Revolted Mortimer!

He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,

But by the chance of war: to prove that true

Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,

Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took,

When on the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,

In single opposition, hand to hand,

He did confound the best part of an hour

In changing hardiment with great Glendower.

Three times they breathed, and three times did they drink,

Upon agreement, of swift Severn’s flood;

Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,

Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,

And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank

Blood-stained with these valiant combatants.

Never did base and rotten policy

Colour her working with such deadly wounds;

Nor never could the noble Mortimer

Receive so many, and all willingly:

Then let not him be slander’d with revolt.



KING.

Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;

He never did encounter with Glendower:

I tell thee,

He durst as well have met the Devil alone

As Owen Glendower for an enemy.

Art not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth

Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:

Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,

Or you shall hear in such a kind from me

As will displease you.—My Lord Northumberland,

We license your departure with your son.—

Send us your prisoners, or you’ll hear of it.



[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train.]

HOTSPUR.

An if the Devil come and roar for them,

I will not send them: I will after straight,

And tell him so; for I will else my heart,

Although it be with hazard of my head.



NORTHUMBERLAND.

What, drunk with choler? stay, and pause awhile:

Here comes your uncle.



[Re-enter Worcester.]

HOTSPUR.

Speak of Mortimer!

Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul

Want mercy, if I do not join with him:

Yea, on his part I’ll empty all these veins,

And shed my dear blood drop by drop i’ the dust,

But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer

As high i’ the air as this unthankful King,

As this ingrate and canker’d Bolingbroke.



NORTH.

[To Worcester.]

Brother, the King hath made your nephew mad.

WORCESTER.

Who struck this heat up after I was gone?



HOTSPUR.

He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;

And when I urged the ransom once again

Of my wife’s brother, then his cheek look’d pale,

And on my face he turn’d an eye of death,

Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.



WORCESTER.

I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim’d

By Richard that dead is the next of blood?



NORTHUMBERLAND.

He was; I heard the proclamation:

And then it was when the unhappy King—

Whose wrongs in us God pardon!—did set forth

Upon his Irish expedition;

From whence he intercepted did return

To be deposed, and shortly murdered.



WORCESTER.

And for whose death we in the world’s wide mouth

Live scandalized and foully spoken of.



HOTSPUR.

But, soft! I pray you; did King Richard then

Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer

Heir to the crown?



NORTHUMBERLAND.

He did; myself did hear it.



HOTSPUR.

Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin King,

That wish’d him on the barren mountains starve.

But shall it be, that you, that set the crown

Upon the head of this forgetful man,

And for his sake wear the detested blot

Of murderous subornation,—shall it be,

That you a world of curses undergo,

Being the agents, or base second means,

The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?—

O, pardon me, that I descend so low,

To show the line and the predicament

Wherein you range under this subtle King;—

Shall it, for shame, be spoken in these days,

Or fill up chronicles in time to come,

That men of your nobility and power

Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,—

As both of you, God pardon it! have done,—

To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,

And plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?

And shall it, in more shame, be further spoken,

That you are fool’d, discarded, and shook off

By him for whom these shames ye underwent?

No! yet time serves, wherein you may redeem

Your banish’d honours, and restore yourselves

Into the good thoughts of the world again;

Revenge the jeering and disdain’d contempt

Of this proud King, who studies day and night

To answer all the debt he owes to you

Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:

Therefore, I say,—



WORCESTER.

Peace, cousin, say no more:

And now I will unclasp a secret book,

And to your quick-conceiving discontent

I’ll read you matter deep and dangerous;

As full of peril and adventurous spirit

As to o’er-walk a current roaring loud

On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.



HOTSPUR.

If we fall in, good night, or sink or swim!

Send danger from the east unto the west,

So honour cross it from the north to south,

And let them grapple. O, the blood more stirs

To rouse a lion than to start a hare!



NORTHUMBERLAND.

Imagination of some great exploit

Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.



HOTSPUR.

By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,

To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced Moon;

Or dive into the bottom of the deep,

Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,

And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;

So he that doth redeem her thence might wear

Without corrival all her dignities:

But out upon this half-faced fellowship!



WORCESTER.

He apprehends a world of figures here,

But not the form of what he should attend.—

Good cousin, give me audience for a while.



HOTSPUR.

I cry you mercy.



WORCESTER.

Those same noble Scots

That are your prisoners,—



HOTSPUR.

I’ll keep them all;

By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;

No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:

I’ll keep them, by this hand.



WORCESTER.

You start away,

And lend no ear unto my purposes.

Those prisoners you shall keep;—



HOTSPUR.

Nay, I will; that’s flat.

He said he would not ransom Mortimer;

Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer;

But I will find him when he lies asleep,

And in his ear I’ll holla Mortimer!

Nay,

I’ll have a starling shall be taught to speak

Nothing but Mortimer, and give it him,

To keep his anger still in motion.



WORCESTER.

Hear you, cousin; a word.



HOTSPUR.

All studies here I solemnly defy,

Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:

And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,

But that I think his father loves him not,

And would be glad he met with some mischance,

I’d have him poison’d with a pot of ale.



WORCESTER.

Farewell, kinsman: I will talk to you

When you are better temper’d to attend.



NORTHUMBERLAND.

Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool

Art thou, to break into this woman’s mood,

Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!



HOTSPUR.

Why, look you, I am whipp’d and scourged with rods,

Nettled, and stung with pismires, when I hear

Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.

In Richard’s time,—what do you call the place?—

A plague upon’t!—it is in Gioucestershire;—

’Twas where the madcap Duke his uncle kept,

His uncle York;—where I first bow’d my knee

Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke;—

When you and he came back from Ravenspurg.



NORTHUMBERLAND.

At Berkeley-castle.



HOTSPUR.

You say true:—

Why, what a candy deal of courtesy

This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!

Look, when his infant fortune came to age,

And, Gentle Harry Percy, and kind cousin,—

O, the Devil take such cozeners!—God forgive me!—

Good uncle, tell your tale; for I have done.



WORCESTER.

Nay, if you have not, to’t again;

We’ll stay your leisure.



HOTSPUR.

I have done, i’faith.



WORCESTER.

Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.

Deliver them up without their ransom straight,

And make the Douglas’ son your only mean

For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons

Which I shall send you written, be assured,

Will easily be granted.—

[To Northumberland.] You, my lord,

Your son in Scotland being thus employ’d,

Shall secretly into the bosom creep

Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,

Th’ Archbishop.



HOTSPUR.

Of York, is’t not?



WORCESTER.

True; who bears hard

His brother’s death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.

I speak not this in estimation,

As what I think might be, but what I know

Is ruminated, plotted, and set down,

And only stays but to behold the face

Of that occasion that shall bring it on.



HOTSPUR.

I smell’t: upon my life, it will do well.



NORTHUMBERLAND.

Before the game’s a-foot, thou still lett’st slip.



HOTSPUR.

Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot:—

And then the power of Scotland and of York

To join with Mortimer, ha?



WORCESTER.

And so they shall.



HOTSPUR.

In faith, it is exceedingly well aim’d.

WORCESTER.

And ’tis no little reason bids us speed,

To save our heads by raising of a head;

For, bear ourselves as even as we can,

The King will always think him in our debt,

And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,

Till he hath found a time to pay us home:

And see already how he doth begin

To make us strangers to his looks of love.



HOTSPUR.

He does, he does: we’ll be revenged on him.



WORCESTER.

Cousin, farewell: no further go in this

Than I by letters shall direct your course.

When time is ripe,— which will be suddenly,—

I’ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;

Where you and Douglas, and our powers at once,

As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,

To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,

Which now we hold at much uncertainty.



NORTHUMBERLAND.

Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.



HOTSPUR.

Uncle, adieu: O, let the hours be short,

Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!



[Exeunt.]





ACT II


SCENE I. Rochester. An Inn-Yard.


[Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand.]

FIRST CARRIER.

Heigh-ho! an’t be not four by the day, I’ll be hang’d:

Charles’ wain is over the new chimney, and yet our horse’ not

pack’d.—What, ostler!



OSTLER.

[within.] Anon, anon.

FIRST CARRIER.

I pr’ythee, Tom, beat Cut’s saddle, put a few flocks in the point; the poor jade is wrung in the withers out of all cess.

[Enter another Carrier.]

SECOND CARRIER.

Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that is the next way to give poor jades the bots; this house is turned upside down since Robin ostler died.

FIRST CARRIER.

Poor fellow! never joyed since the price of oats rose; it was the death of him.

SECOND CARRIER.

I think this be the most villainous house in all London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.

FIRST CARRIER.

Like a tench! by the Mass, there is ne’er a king in Christendom could be better bit than I have been since the first cock.—What,

ostler! come away and be hang’d; come away.

SECOND CARRIER.

I have a gammon of bacon and two razes of ginger, to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.

FIRST CARRIER.

’Odsbody! the turkeys in my pannier are quite starved.—What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An ’twere not as good a deed as drink to break the pate of thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hang’d: hast no faith in thee?

[Enter Gadshill.]

GADSHILL.

Good morrow, carriers. What’s o’clock?



FIRST CARRIER.

I think it be two o’clock.

GADSHILL.

I pr’ythee, lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding in the stable.

FIRST CARRIER.

Nay, soft, I pray ye; I know a trick worth two of that, i’faith.

GADSHILL.

I pr’ythee, lend me thine.



SECOND CARRIER.

Ay, when? canst tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth a? marry, I’ll see thee hang’d first.

GADSHILL.

Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?



SECOND CARRIER.

Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant thee.—

Come, neighbour Muggs, we’ll call up the gentlemen: they will

along with company, for they have great charge.



[Exeunt Carriers.]

GADSHILL.

What, ho! chamberlain!



CHAMBERLAIN.

[Within.] At hand, quoth pick-purse.



GADSHILL.

That’s even as fair as—at hand, quoth the chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring; thou lay’st the plot how.

[Enter Chamberlain.]

CHAMBERLAIN.

Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that I told you yesternight: there’s a franklin in the wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what. They are up already, and call for eggs and butter; they will away presently.

GADSHILL.

Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas’ clerks, I’ll give thee this neck.

CHAMBERLAIN.

No, I’ll none of it: I pr’ythee, keep that for the hangman; for

I know thou worshippest Saint Nicholas as truly as a man of

falsehood may.



GADSHILL.

What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, I’ll make a fat pair of gallows; for, if I hang, old Sir John hangs with me, and thou know’st he is no starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou dreamest not of, the which, for sport-sake, are content to do the profession some grace; that would, if matters should be look’d into, for their own credit-sake, make all whole. I am joined with no foot land-rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers, none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms; but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and great oneyers; such as can hold in, such as will strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zwounds, I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the Commonwealth; or, rather, not pray to her, but prey on her, for they ride up and down on her, and make her their boots.

CHAMBERLAIN.

What, the Commonwealth their boots? will she hold out water in foul way?

GADSHILL.

She will, she will; justice hath liquor’d her. We steal as in a castle, cock-sure; we have the receipt of fernseed,—we walk invisible.

CHAMBERLAIN.

Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.

GADSHILL.

Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our purchase, as

I am a true man.



CHAMBERLAIN.

Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.



GADSHILL.

Go to; homo is a common name to all men. Bid the ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell, you muddy knave.

[Exeunt.]





SCENE II. The Road by Gads-hill.


[Enter Prince Henry and Poins; Bardolph and Peto at some distance.]

POINS.

Come, shelter, shelter: I have remov’d Falstaff’s horse, and he frets like a gumm’d velvet.

PRINCE.

Stand close.



[They retire.]

[Enter Falstaff.]

FALSTAFF.

Poins! Poins, and be hang’d! Poins!



PRINCE.

[Coming forward.]

Peace, ye fat-kidney’d rascal! what a brawling dost thou keep!

FALSTAFF.

Where’s Poins, Hal?



PRINCE.

He is walk’d up to the top of the hill: I’ll go seek him.



[Retires.]

FALSTAFF.

I am accursed to rob in that thief’s company: the rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know not where. If I travel but four foot by the squire further a-foot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I ’scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have forsworn his company hourly any time this two-and-twenty year, and yet I am bewitch’d with the rogue’s company. If the rascal have not given me medicines to make me love him, I’ll be hang’d; it could not be else: I have drunk medicines.— Poins!—Hal!—a plague upon you both!—Bardolph!—Peto!—I’ll starve, ere I’ll rob a foot further. An ’twere not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man, and to leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven ground is threescore and ten miles a-foot with me; and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough: a plague upon’t, when thieves cannot be true one to another! [They whistle.] Whew!—A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you rogues; give me my horse, and be hang’d!

PRINCE.

[Coming forward.] Peace! lie down; lay thine ear close to the ground, and list if thou canst hear the tread of travellers.

FALSTAFF.

Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down? ’Sblood, I’ll not bear mine own flesh so far a-foot again for all the coin in thy father’s exchequer. What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?

PRINCE.

Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.



FALSTAFF.

I pr’ythee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse, good king’s son.

PRINCE.

Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?



FALSTAFF.

Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent garters! If I be ta’en, I’ll peach for this. An I have not ballads made on you all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison. When a jest is so forward, and a-foot too, I hate it.

[Enter Gadshill.]

GADSHILL.

Stand!



FALSTAFF.

So I do, against my will.



POINS.

O, ’tis our setter: I know his voice.



[Comes forward with Bardolph and Peto.]

BARDOLPH.

What news?



GADSHILL.

Case ye, case ye; on with your visards: there’s money of the King’s coming down the hill; ’tis going to the King’s exchequer.

FALSTAFF.

You lie, ye rogue; ’tis going to the King’s tavern.



GADSHILL.

There’s enough to make us all.



FALSTAFF.

To be hang’d.



PRINCE.

Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane; Ned

Poins and I will walk lower; if they ’scape from your

encounter, then they light on us.



PETO.

How many be there of them?



GADSHILL.

Some eight or ten.



FALSTAFF.

Zwounds, will they not rob us?



PRINCE.

What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?



FALSTAFF.

Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather; but yet no coward, Hal.

PRINCE.

Well, we leave that to the proof.



POINS.

Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge: when thou need’st him, there thou shalt find him. Farewell, and stand fast.

FALSTAFF.

Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hang’d.



PRINCE.

[aside to POINTZ.] Ned, where are our disguises?

POINS.

[aside to PRINCE HENRY.] Here, hard by: stand close.

[Exeunt Prince and Poins.]

FALSTAFF.

Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I: every man to his business.

[Enter Travellers.]

FIRST TRAVELLER.

Come, neighbour:

The boy shall lead our horses down the hill;

We’ll walk a-foot awhile and ease our legs.



FALSTAFF, GADSHILL., &C.

Stand!



SECOND TRAVELLER.

Jesu bless us!



FALSTAFF.

Strike; down with them; cut the villains’ throats. Ah, whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they hate us youth: down with them; fleece them.

FIRST TRAVELLER.

O, we’re undone, both we and ours for ever!



FALSTAFF.

Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye fat chuffs; I would your store were here! On, bacons on! What, ye knaves! young men must live. You are grand-jurors, are ye? we’ll jure ye, i’faith.

[Exeunt Fals., Gads., &c., driving the Travellers out.]

[Re-enter Prince Henry and Poins, in buckram suits.]

PRINCE.

The thieves have bound the true men. Now, could thou and I rob the thieves, and go merrily to London, it would be argument for a week, laughter for a month, and a good jest for ever.

POINS.

Stand close: I hear them coming.



[They retire.]

[Re-enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto.]

FALSTAFF.

Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse before day.

An the Prince and Poins be not two arrant cowards, there’s no

equity stirring: there’s no more valour in that Poins than in a



wild duck.

[As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon them.]

PRINCE.

Your money!



POINS.

Villains!



[Falstaff, after a blow or two, and the others run away, leaving the booty behind them.]

PRINCE.

Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:

The thieves are scatter’d, and possess’d with fear

So strongly that they dare not meet each other;

Each takes his fellow for an officer.

Away, good Ned. Fat Falstaff sweats to death,

And lards the lean earth as he walks along:

Were’t not for laughing, I should pity him.



POINS.

How the rogue roar’d!



[Exeunt.]





SCENE III. Warkworth. A Room in the Castle.


[Enter Hotspur, reading a letter.]

HOTSPUR.

—But, for mine own part, my lord, I could be well contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear your House.—He could be contented; why is he not, then? In respect of the love he bears our House!—he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than he loves our house. Let me see some more. The purpose you undertake is dangerous;—Why, that’s certain: ’tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. The purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition.— Say you so, say you so? I say unto you again, you are a shallow, cowardly hind, and you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord, our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our friends true and constant: a good plot, good friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot, very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is this! Why, my Lord of York commends the plot and the general course of the action. Zwounds! an I were now by this rascal, I could brain him with his lady’s fan. Is there not my father, my uncle, and myself? Lord Edmund Mortimer, my Lord of York, and Owen Glendower? is there not, besides, the Douglas? have I not all their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the next month? and are they not some of them set forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an infidel! Ha! you shall see now, in very sincerity of fear and cold heart, will he to the King, and lay open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself, and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of skimm’d milk with so honourable an action! Hang him! let him tell the King: we are prepared. I will set forward to-night.—

[Enter Lady Percy.]

How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.

LADY PERCY.

O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?

For what offence have I this fortnight been

A banish’d woman from my Harry’s bed?

Tell me, sweet lord, what is’t that takes from thee

Thy stomach, pleasure, and thy golden sleep?

Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,

And start so often when thou sitt’st alone?

Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;

And given my treasures and my rights of thee

To thick-eyed musing and curst melancholy?

In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch’d,

And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;

Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;

Cry Courage! to the field! And thou hast talk’d

Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,

Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,

Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,

Of prisoners ransomed, and of soldiers slain,

And all the currents of a heady fight.

Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war,

And thus hath so bestirr’d thee in thy sleep,

That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow,

Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;

And in thy face strange motions have appear’d,

Such as we see when men restrain their breath

On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?

Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,

And I must know it, else he loves me not.



HOTSPUR.

What, ho!



[Enter a Servant.]

Is Gilliams with the packet gone?

SERVANT.

He is, my lord, an hour ago.



HOTSPUR.

Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?



SERVANT.

One horse, my lord, he brought even now.



HOTSPUR.

What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?



SERVANT.

It is, my lord.



HOTSPUR.

That roan shall be my throne.

Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!—

Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.



[Exit Servant.]

LADY PERCY.

But hear you, my lord.



HOTSPUR.

What say’st thou, my lady?



LADY PERCY.

What is it carries you away?



HOTSPUR.

Why, my horse, my love, my horse.



LADY PERCY.

Out, you mad-headed ape!

A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen

As you are toss’d with. In faith,

I’ll know your business, Harry, that I will.

I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir

About his title, and hath sent for you

To line his enterprise: but if you go,—



HOTSPUR.

So far a-foot, I shall be weary, love.



LADY PERCY.

Come, come, you paraquito, answer me

Directly to this question that I ask:

In faith, I’ll break thy little finger, Harry,

An if thou wilt not tell me true.



HOTSPUR.

Away,

Away, you trifler! Love? I love thee not,

I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world

To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:

We must have bloody noses and crack’d crowns,

And pass them current too.—Gods me, my horse!—

What say’st thou, Kate? what wouldst thou have with me?



LADY PERCY.

Do you not love me? do you not indeed?

Well, do not, then; for, since you love me not,

I will not love myself. Do you not love me?

Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.



HOTSPUR.

Come, wilt thou see me ride?

And when I am o’ horseback, I will swear

I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;

I must not have you henceforth question me

Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:

Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,

This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.

I know you wise; but yet no further wise

Than Harry Percy’s wife; constant you are;

But yet a woman: and, for secrecy,

No lady closer; for I well believe

Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;

And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.



LADY PERCY.

How! so far?



HOTSPUR.

Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:

Whither I go, thither shall you go too;

To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.

Will this content you, Kate?



LADY PERCY.

It must of force.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE IV. Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar’s-Head Tavern.


[Enter Prince Henry.]

PRINCE.

Ned, pr’ythee, come out of that fat room, and lend me thy hand to laugh a little.

[Enter Poins.]

POINS.

Where hast been, Hal?



PRINCE.

With three or four loggerheads amongst three or fourscore hogsheads. I have sounded the very base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by their Christian names, as, Tom, Dick, and Francis. They take it already upon their salvation, that though I be but Prince of Wales, yet I am the king of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack, like Falstaff, but a corinthian, a lad of mettle, a good boy,—by the Lord, so they call me;—and, when I am King of England, I shall command all the good lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dying scarlet; and, when you breathe in your watering, they cry hem! and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour, that I can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this action. But, sweet Ned,—to sweeten which name of Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapp’d even now into my hand by an under-skinker; one that never spake other English in his life than Eight shillings and sixpence, and You are welcome; with this shrill addition, Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint of bastard in the Half-moon,—or so. But, Ned, to drive away the time till Falstaff come, I pr’ythee, do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do thou never leave calling Francis! that his tale to me may be nothing but Anon. Step aside, and I’ll show thee a precedent.

[Exit Poins.]

POINS.

[Within.] Francis!



PRINCE.



Thou art perfect.

POINS.

[Within.] Francis!



[Enter Francis.]

FRANCIS.

Anon, anon, sir.—Look down into the Pomegranate, Ralph.



PRINCE.

Come hither, Francis.



FRANCIS.

My lord?



PRINCE.

How long hast thou to serve, Francis?



FRANCIS.

Forsooth, five years, and as much as to—



POINS.

[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.

Anon, anon, sir.



PRINCE.

Five year! by’r Lady, a long lease for the clinking of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it a fair pair of heels and run from it?

FRANCIS.

O Lord, sir, I’ll be sworn upon all the books in England,

I could find in my heart—



POINS.

[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.

Anon, anon, sir.



PRINCE.

How old art thou, Francis?



FRANCIS.

Let me see,—about Michaelmas next I shall be—



POINS.

[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.

Anon, sir.—Pray you, stay a little, my lord.



PRINCE.

Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou gavest me, ’twas a pennyworth, was’t not?

FRANCIS.

O Lord, sir, I would it had been two!



PRINCE.

I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.

POINS.

[within.] Francis!

FRANCIS.

Anon, anon.



PRINCE.

Anon, Francis? No, Francis; but to-morrow, Francis; or,

Francis, a Thursday; or, indeed, Francis, when thou wilt. But,

Francis,—



FRANCIS.

My lord?



PRINCE.

—wilt thou rob this leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, nott-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,—

FRANCIS.

O Lord, sir, who do you mean?



PRINCE.

Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink; for, look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.

FRANCIS.

What, sir?



POINS.

[within.] Francis!

PRINCE.

Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?



[Here they both call him; Francis stands amazed, not knowing which way to go.]

[Enter Vintner.]

VINTNER.

What, stand’st thou still, and hear’st such a calling? Look to the guests within. [Exit Francis.]—My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are at the door: shall I let them in?

PRINCE.

Let them alone awhile, and then open the door.



[Exit Vintner.]

Poins!

[Re-enter Poins.]

POINS.

Anon, anon, sir.



PRINCE.

Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at the door: shall we be merry?

POINS.

As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what cunning match have you made with this jest of the drawer? Come, what’s the issue?

PRINCE.

I am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the pupil age of this present twelve o’clock at midnight.—What’s o’clock, Francis?

FRANCIS.

[Within.] Anon, anon, sir.



PRINCE.

That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is up-stairs and down-stairs; his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy’s mind, the Hotspur of the North; he that kills me some six or seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his hands, and says to his wife, Fie upon this quiet life! I want work. O my sweet Harry, says she, how many hast thou kill’d to-day? Give my roan horse a drench, says he; and answers, Some fourteen, an hour after,—a trifle, a trifle. I pr’ythee, call in Falstaff: I’ll play Percy, and that damn’d brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his wife. Rivo! says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.

[Enter Falstaff, Gadshill, Bardolph, and Peto; followed by

Francis with wine.]



POINS.

Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?



FALSTAFF.

A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and

amen!—

Give me a cup of sack, boy.—Ere I lead this life long, I’ll sew

nether-stocks, and mend them and foot them too. A plague of all

cowards!—

Give me a cup of sack, rogue.—Is there no virtue extant?



[Drinks.]

PRINCE.

Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter? pitiful-hearted butter, that melted at the sweet tale of the Sun! if thou didst, then behold that compound.

FALSTAFF.

You rogue, here’s lime in this sack too: there is nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man: yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it, a villanous coward.—Go thy ways, old Jack: die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the Earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live not three good men unhang’d in England; and one of them is fat, and grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say. I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any thing. A plague of all cowards! I say still.

PRINCE.

How now, wool-sack? what mutter you?



FALSTAFF.

A king’s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese, I’ll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!

PRINCE.

Why, you whoreson round man, what’s the matter?



FALSTAFF.

Are not you a coward? answer me to that:—and Poins there?



POINS.

Zwounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the Lord, I’ll stab thee.

FALSTAFF.

I call thee coward! I’ll see thee damn’d ere I call thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound, I could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight enough in the shoulders; you care not who sees your back: call you that backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing! give me them that will face me.—Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I drunk to-day.

PRINCE.

O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunk’st last.



FALSTAFF.

All is one for that. A plague of all cowards! still say I.



[Drinks.]

PRINCE.

What’s the matter?



FALSTAFF.

What’s the matter? there be four of us here have ta’en a thousand pound this day morning.

PRINCE.

Where is it, Jack? where is it?



FALSTAFF.

Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon poor four of us!



PRINCE.

What, a hundred, man?



FALSTAFF.

I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two hours together. I have ’scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut through and through; my sword hack’d like a hand-saw,—ecce signum! I never dealt better since I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.

PRINCE.

Speak, sirs; how was it?



GADSHILL.

We four set upon some dozen,—



FALSTAFF.

Sixteen at least, my lord.



GADSHILL.

—and bound them.

PETO.

No, no; they were not bound.



FALSTAFF.

You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.

GADSHILL.

As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men sea upon us,—



FALSTAFF.

And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.



PRINCE.

What, fought you with them all?



FALSTAFF.

All? I know not what you call all; but if I fought not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.

PRINCE.

Pray God you have not murdered some of them.



FALSTAFF.

Nay, that’s past praying for: I have pepper’d two of them; two I

am sure I have paid, two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what,

Hal, if I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse.

Thou knowest my old ward: here I lay, and thus I bore my point.

Four rogues in buckram let drive at me,—



PRINCE.

What, four? thou saidst but two even now.



FALSTAFF.

Four, Hal; I told thee four.



POINS.

Ay, ay, he said four.



FALSTAFF.

These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target, thus.

PRINCE.

Seven? why, there were but four even now.



FALSTAFF.

In buckram?



POINS.

Ay, four, in buckram suits.



FALSTAFF.

Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.



PRINCE.

[aside to Poins.] Pr’ythee let him alone; we shall have more anon.

FALSTAFF.

Dost thou hear me, Hal?



PRINCE.

Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.



FALSTAFF.

Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram that I told thee of,—

PRINCE.

So, two more already.



FALSTAFF.

—their points being broken,—

POINS.

Down fell their hose.



FALSTAFF.

—began to give me ground: but I followed me close, came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of the eleven I paid.

PRINCE.

O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!



FALSTAFF.

But, as the Devil would have it, three misbegotten knaves in Kendal

Green came at my back and let drive at me; for it was so dark, Hal,

that thou couldst not see thy hand.



PRINCE.

These lies are like the father that begets them, gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou nott-pated fool, thou whoreson, obscene greasy tallow-keech,—

FALSTAFF.

What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth the truth?



PRINCE.

Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?

POINS.

Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.



FALSTAFF.

What, upon compulsion? No; were I at the strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on compulsion! if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon compulsion, I.

PRINCE.

I’ll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine coward, this bed-presser, this horse-back-breaker, this huge hill of flesh,—

FALSTAFF.

Away, you starveling, you eel-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, you

stock-fish,—

O, for breath to utter what is like thee!—you tailor’s-yard, you

sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck,—



PRINCE.

Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and, when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons, hear me speak but this:—

POINS.

Mark, Jack.



PRINCE.

—We two saw you four set on four; you bound them, and were masters of their wealth.—Mark now, how a plain tale shall put you down.— Then did we two set on you four; and, with a word, outfaced you from your prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in the house: and, Falstaff, you carried yourself away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared for mercy, and still ran and roar’d, as ever I heard bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! What trick, what device, what starting-hole canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame?

POINS.

Come, let’s hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?





FALSTAFF.

By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why, hear ye, my masters: Was it for me to kill the heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true Prince? why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true Prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a coward on instinct. I shall think the better of myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, lads, I am glad you have the money.— [To Hostess within.] Hostess, clap-to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.—Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be merry? shall we have a play extempore?

PRINCE.

Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.



FALSTAFF.

Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!



[Enter the Hostess.]

HOSTESS.

O Jesu, my lord the Prince,—



PRINCE.

How now, my lady the hostess! What say’st thou to me?



HOSTESS.

Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the Court at door would speak with you: he says he comes from your father.

PRINCE.

Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and send him back again to my mother.

FALSTAFF.

What manner of man is he?



HOSTESS.

An old man.



FALSTAFF.

What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him his answer?

PRINCE.

Pr’ythee, do, Jack.



FALSTAFF.

Faith, and I’ll send him packing.



[Exit.]

PRINCE.

Now, sirs:—by’r Lady, you fought fair;—so did you, Peto;—so did you,

Bardolph: you are lions, too, you ran away upon instinct, you will not

touch the true Prince; no,—fie!



BARDOLPH.

Faith, I ran when I saw others run.



PRINCE.

Tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff’s sword so hack’d?



PETO.

Why, he hack’d it with his dagger; and said he would swear truth out of

England, but he would make you believe it was done in fight; and

persuaded us to do the like.



BARDOLPH.

Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to make them bleed; and then to beslubber our garments with it, and swear it was the blood of true men. I did that I did not this seven year before; I blush’d to hear his monstrous devices.

PRINCE.

O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since thou hast blush’d extempore. Thou hadst fire and sword on thy side, and yet thou rann’st away: what instinct hadst thou for it?

BARDOLPH.

My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold these exhalations?

PRINCE.

I do.



BARDOLPH.

What think you they portend?



PRINCE.

Hot livers and cold purses.



BARDOLPH.

Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.



PRINCE.

No, if rightly taken, halter.—Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.—

[Enter Falstaff.]

How now, my sweet creature of bombast! How long is’t ago, Jack, since thou saw’st thine own knee?

FALSTAFF.

My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was not an eagle’s talon in the waist; I could have crept into any alderman’s thumb-ring: a plague of sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a bladder. There’s villanous news abroad: here was Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the Court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the North, Percy; and he of Wales, that gave Amaimon the bastinado, and swore the Devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh hook,—what a plague call you him?

POINS.

O, Glendower.



FALSTAFF.

Owen, Owen,—the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer; and old

Northumberland; and that sprightly Scot of Scots, Douglas, that

runs o’ horseback up a hill perpendicular,—



PRINCE.

He that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying.

FALSTAFF.

You have hit it.



PRINCE.

So did he never the sparrow.



FALSTAFF.

Well, that rascal hath good metal in him; he will not run.



PRINCE.

Why, what a rascal art thou, then, to praise him so for running!



FALSTAFF.

O’ horseback, ye cuckoo! but a-foot he will not budge a foot.



PRINCE.

Yes, Jack, upon instinct.



FALSTAFF.

I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father’s beard is turn’d white with the news: you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. But, tell me, Hal, art not thou horrible afeard? thou being heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? art thou not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at it?

PRINCE.

Not a whit, i’faith; I lack some of thy instinct.



FALSTAFF.

Well, thou wilt be horribly chid to-morrow when thou comest to thy father. If thou love life, practise an answer.

PRINCE.

Do thou stand for my father and examine me upon the particulars of my life.

FALSTAFF.

Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.

PRINCE.

Thy state is taken for a joint-stool, thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown.

FALSTAFF.

Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, now shalt thou be moved.— Give me a cup of sack, to make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it in King Cambyses’ vein.

PRINCE.

Well, here is my leg.



FALSTAFF.

And here is my speech.—Stand aside, nobility.



HOSTESS.

O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i faith!



FALSTAFF.

Weep not, sweet Queen; for trickling tears are vain.



HOSTESS.

O, the Father, how he holds his countenance!



FALSTAFF.

For God’s sake, lords, convey my tristful Queen;

For tears do stop the floodgates of her eyes.



HOSTESS.

O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever

I see!



FALSTAFF.

Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.—Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though the camomile, the more it is trodden on, the faster it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted, the sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have partly thy mother’s word, partly my own opinion; but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye, and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant me. If, then, thou be son to me, here lies the point: Why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall the blessed Sun of heaven prove a micher, and eat blackberries? a question not to be ask’d. Shall the son of England prove a thief, and take purses? a question to be ask’d. There is a thing, Harry, which thou hast often heard of, and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch, as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not speak to thee in drink, but in tears; not in pleasure, but in passion; not in words only, but in woes also. And yet there is a virtuous man whom I have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.

PRINCE.

What manner of man, an it like your Majesty?



FALSTAFF.

A goodly portly man, i’faith, and a corpulent; of a cheerful look, a pleasing eye, and a most noble carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or, by’r Lady, inclining to threescore; and now I remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, I see virtue in his looks. If, then, the tree may be known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then, peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me where hast thou been this month?

PRINCE.

Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, and I’ll play my father.

FALSTAFF.

Depose me! if thou dost it half so gravely, so majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter’s hare.

PRINCE.

Well, here I am set.



FALSTAFF.

And here I stand.—Judge, my masters.



PRINCE.

Now, Harry, whence come you?



FALSTAFF.

My noble lord, from Eastcheap.



PRINCE.

The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.



FALSTAFF.

’Sblood, my lord, they are false.—Nay, I’ll tickle ye for a young prince, i’faith.

PRINCE.

Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne’er look on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace: there is a devil haunts thee, in the likeness of an old fat man,—a tun of man is thy companion. Why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that roasted Manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly, that reverend Vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft? wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villainous, but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?

FALSTAFF.

I would your Grace would take me with you: whom means your Grace?



PRINCE.

That villainous abominable misleader of youth, Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.

FALSTAFF.

My lord, the man I know.



PRINCE.

I know thou dost.



FALSTAFF.

But to say I know more harm in him than in myself, were to say more than I know. That he is old,—(the more the pity,—his white hairs do witness it. If sack and sugar be a fault, God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a sin, then many an old host that I know is damn’d: if to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh’s lean kine are to be loved. No, my good lord: banish Peto, banish Bardolph, banish Poins; but, for sweet Jack Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him thy Harry’s company, banish not him thy Harry’s company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.

PRINCE.

I do, I will.



[A knocking heard.]

[Exeunt Hostess, Francis, and Bardolph.]

[Enter Bardolph, running.]

BARDOLPH.

O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door.

FALSTAFF.

Out, ye rogue!—Play out the play: I have much to say in the behalf of that Falstaff.

[Re-enter the Hostess, hastily.]

HOSTESS.

O Jesu, my lord, my lord,—



PRINCE.

Heigh, heigh! the Devil rides upon a fiddlestick: what’s the matter?



HOSTESS.

The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?

FALSTAFF.

Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad without seeming so.

PRINCE.

And thou a natural coward, without instinct.



FALSTAFF.

I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff, so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up! I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.

PRINCE.

Go, hide thee behind the arras:—the rest walk, up above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good conscience.

FALSTAFF.

Both which I have had; but their date is out, and therefore I’ll hide me.

PRINCE.

Call in the sheriff.—



[Exeunt all but the Prince and Poins.]

[Enter Sheriff and Carrier.]

Now, master sheriff, what’s your will with me?

SHERIFF.

First, pardon me, my lord. A hue-and-cry

Hath followed certain men unto this house.



PRINCE.

What men?



SHERIFF.

One of them is well known, my gracious lord,—

A gross fat man.



CARRIER.

As fat as butter.



PRINCE.

The man, I do assure you, is not here;

For I myself at this time have employ’d him.

And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee,

That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,

Send him to answer thee, or any man,

For any thing he shall be charged withal:

And so, let me entreat you leave the house.



SHERIFF.

I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen

Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.



PRINCE.

It may be so: if he have robb’d these men,

He shall be answerable; and so, farewell.



SHERIFF.

Good night, my noble lord.



PRINCE.

I think it is good morrow, is it not?



SHERIFF.

Indeed, my lord, I think’t be two o’clock.



[Exit Sheriff and Carrier.]

PRINCE.

This oily rascal is known as well as Paul’s. Go, call him forth.



POINS.

Falstaff!—fast asleep behind the arras, and snorting like a horse.

PRINCE.

Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.



[Poins searches.]

What hast thou found?

POINS.

Nothing but papers, my lord.



PRINCE.

Let’s see what they be: read them.



POINS.

[reads]

Item, A capon, . . . . . . . . . 2s. 2d.

Item, Sauce, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4d.

Item, Sack two gallons ,. . . 5s. 8d.

Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.

Item, Bread, . . . . . . . . . . . . . .ob.



PRINCE.

O monstrous! but one half-pennyworth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else, keep close; we’ll read it at more advantage: there let him sleep till day. I’ll to the Court in the morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place shall be honourable. I’ll procure this fat rogue a charge of foot; and I know his death will be a march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in the morning; and so, good morrow, Poins.

POINS.

Good morrow, good my lord.



[Exeunt.]





ACT III


SCENE I. Bangor. A Room in the Archdeacon’s House.


[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, Mortimer, and Glendower.]

MORTIMER.

These promises are fair, the parties sure,

And our induction full of prosperous hope.



HOTSPUR.

Lord Mortimer,—and cousin Glendower,—Will you sit down?—

And uncle Worcester,—A plague upon it! I have forgot the map.



GLENDOWER.

No, here it is.

Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur;

For by that name as oft as Lancaster

Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale, and with

A rising sigh he wisheth you in Heaven.



HOTSPUR.

And you in Hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.



GLENDOWER.

I cannot blame him: at my nativity

The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,

Of burning cressets; ay, and at my birth

The frame and huge foundation of the Earth

Shaked like a coward.



HOTSPUR.

Why, so it would have done at the same season, if your mother’s cat had but kitten’d, though yourself had never been born.

GLENDOWER.

I say the Earth did shake when I was born.



HOTSPUR.

And I say the Earth was not of my mind, if you suppose as fearing you it shook.

GLENDOWER.

The Heavens were all on fire, the Earth did tremble.



HOTSPUR.

O, then th’ Earth shook to see the Heavens on fire,

And not in fear of your nativity.

Diseased Nature oftentimes breaks forth

In strange eruptions; oft the teeming Earth

Is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d

By the imprisoning of unruly wind

Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,

Shakes the old beldam Earth, and topples down

Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth,

Our grandam Earth, having this distemperature,

In passion shook.



GLENDOWER.

Cousin, of many men

I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave

To tell you once again, that at my birth

The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes;

The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds

Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.

These signs have mark’d me extraordinary;

And all the courses of my life do show

I am not in the roll of common men.

Where is he living,—clipp’d in with the sea

That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,—

Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?

And bring him out that is but woman’s son

Can trace me in the tedious ways of art,

And hold me pace in deep experiments.



HOTSPUR.

I think there is no man speaks better Welsh.—I’ll to dinner.



MORTIMER.

Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.



GLENDOWER.

I can call spirits from the vasty deep.



HOTSPUR.

Why, so can I, or so can any man;

But will they come when you do call for them?



GLENDOWER.

Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command the Devil.



HOTSPUR.

And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the Devil

By telling truth: tell truth, and shame the Devil.

If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,

And I’ll be sworn I’ve power to shame him hence.

O, while you live, tell truth, and shame the Devil!



MORTIMER.

Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.



GLENDOWER.

Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head

Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye

And sandy-bottom’d Severn have I sent

Him bootless home and weather-beaten back.



HOTSPUR.

Home without boots, and in foul weather too!

How ’scaped he agues, in the Devil’s name!



GLENDOWER.

Come, here’s the map: shall we divide our right

According to our threefold order ta’en?



MORTIMER.

Th’ archdeacon hath divided it

Into three limits very equally.

England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,

By south and east is to my part assign’d:

All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,

And all the fertile land within that bound,

To Owen Glendower:—and, dear coz, to you

The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.

And our indentures tripartite are drawn;

Which being sealed interchangeably,—

A business that this night may execute,—

To-morrow, cousin Percy, you, and I,

And my good Lord of Worcester, will set forth

To meet your father and the Scottish power,

As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.

My father Glendower is not ready yet,

Nor shall we need his help these fourteen days:—

[To Glend.] Within that space you may have drawn together

Your tenants, friends, and neighbouring gentlemen.



GLENDOWER.

A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:

And in my conduct shall your ladies come;

From whom you now must steal, and take no leave,

For there will be a world of water shed

Upon the parting of your wives and you.



HOTSPUR.

Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,

In quantity equals not one of yours.

See how this river comes me cranking in,

And cuts me from the best of all my land

A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.

I’ll have the current in this place damn’d up;

And here the smug and sliver Trent shall run

In a new channel, fair and evenly:

It shall not wind with such a deep indent,

To rob me of so rich a bottom here.



GLENDOWER.

Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.



MORTIMER.

Yea, but

Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up

With like advantage on the other side;

Gelding th’ opposed continent as much

As on the other side it takes from you.



WORCESTER.

Yea, but a little charge will trench him here,

And on this north side win this cape of land;

And then he runneth straight and evenly.



HOTSPUR.

I’ll have it so: a little charge will do it.



GLENDOWER.

I will not have it alter’d.



HOTSPUR.

Will not you?



GLENDOWER.

No, nor you shall not.



HOTSPUR.

Who shall say me nay?



GLENDOWER.

Why, that will I.



HOTSPUR.

Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.



GLENDOWER.

I can speak English, lord, as well as you;

For I was train’d up in the English Court;

Where, being but young, I framed to the harp

Many an English ditty lovely well,

And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,

A virtue that was never seen in you.



HOTSPUR.

Marry, and I am glad of it with all my heart:

I had rather be a kitten, and cry mew,

Than one of these same metre ballet-mongers;

I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn’d,

Or a dry wheel grate on the axletree;

And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,

Nothing so much as mincing poetry:

’Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.



GLENDOWER.

Come, you shall have Trent turn’d.



HOTSPUR.

I do not care: I’ll give thrice so much land

To any well-deserving friend;

But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,

I’ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.

Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?

GLEND.



The Moon shines fair; you may away by night:

I’ll in and haste the writer, and withal

Break with your wives of your departure hence:

I am afraid my daughter will run mad,

So much she doteth on her Mortimer.



[Exit.]

MORTIMER.

Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!



HOTSPUR.

I cannot choose: sometimes he angers me

With telling me of the moldwarp and the ant,

Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,

And of a dragon and a finless fish,

A clip-wing’d griffin and a moulten raven,

A couching lion and a ramping cat,

And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff

As puts me from my faith. I tell you what,

He held me last night at the least nine hours

In reckoning up the several devils’ names

That were his lacqueys: I cried hum, and well,

But mark’d him not a word. O, he’s as tedious

As a tired horse, a railing wife;

Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live

With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,

Than feed on cates and have him talk to me

In any summer-house in Christendom.



MORTIMER.

In faith, he is a worthy gentleman;

Exceedingly well-read, and profited

In strange concealments; valiant as a lion,

And wondrous affable, and as bountiful

As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?

He holds your temper in a high respect,

And curbs himself even of his natural scope

When you do cross his humour; faith, he does:

I warrant you, that man is not alive

Might so have tempted him as you have done,

Without the taste of danger and reproof:

But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.



WORCESTER.

In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blunt;

And since your coming hither have done enough

To put him quite beside his patience.

You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:

Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood—

And that’s the dearest grace it renders you,—

Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,

Defect of manners, want of government,

Pride, haughtiness, opinion, and disdain;

The least of which haunting a nobleman

Loseth men’s hearts, and leaves behind a stain

Upon the beauty of all parts besides,

Beguiling them of commendation.



HOTSPUR.

Well, I am school’d: good manners be your speed!

Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.



[Re-enter Glendower, with Lady Mortimer and Lady Percy.]

MORTIMER.

This is the deadly spite that angers me,

My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.



GLENDOWER.

My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;

She’ll be a soldier too, she’ll to the wars.



MORTIMER.

Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy

Shall follow in your conduct speedily.



[Glendower speaks to Lady Mortimer in Welsh, and she answers him in the same.]

GLENDOWER.

She’s desperate here; a peevish self-will’d harlotry,

One that no persuasion can do good upon.



[Lady Mortimer speaks to Mortimer in Welsh.]

MORTIMER.

I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh

Which thou pour’st down from these swelling heavens

I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,

In such a parley should I answer thee.



[Lady Mortimer speaks to him again in Welsh.]

I understand thy kisses, and thou mine,

And that’s a feeling disputation:

But I will never be a truant, love,

Till I have learn’d thy language; for thy tongue

Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn’d,

Sung by a fair queen in a Summer’s bower,

With ravishing division, to her lute.



GLENDOWER.

Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.



[Lady Mortimer speaks to Mortimer again in Welsh.]

MORTIMER.

O, I am ignorance itself in this!



GLENDOWER.

She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down,

And rest your gentle head upon her lap,

And she will sing the song that pleaseth you,

And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep,

Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness;

Making such difference betwixt wake and sleep,

As is the difference betwixt day and night,

The hour before the heavenly-harness’d team

Begins his golden progress in the East.



MORTIMER.

With all my heart I’ll sit and hear her sing:

By that time will our book, I think, be drawn.



GLENDOWER.

Do so:

An those musicians that shall play to you

Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,

And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.



HOTSPUR.

Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come, quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.

LADY PERCY.

Go, ye giddy goose.



[The music plays.]

HOTSPUR.

Now I perceive the Devil understands Welsh;

And ’tis no marvel he’s so humorous.

By’r Lady, he’s a good musician.



LADY PERCY.

Then should you be nothing but musical; for you are altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief, and hear the lady sing in Welsh.

HOTSPUR.

I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.



LADY PERCY.

Wouldst thou have thy head broken?



HOTSPUR.

No.



LADY PERCY.

Then be still.



HOTSPUR.

Neither; ’tis a woman’s fault.



LADY PERCY.

Now God help thee!



HOTSPUR.

Peace! she sings.



[A Welsh song by Lady Mortimer.]

Come, Kate, I’ll have your song too.

LADY PERCY.

Not mine, in good sooth.



HOTSPUR.

Not yours, in good sooth! ’Heart! you swear like a

comfit-maker’s wife. Not mine, in good sooth; and, As true

as I live; and, As God shall mend me; and, As sure as day;

And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,

As if thou ne’er walk’dst further than Finsbury.

Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,

A good mouth-filling oath; and leave in sooth,

And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,

To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens. Come, sing.



LADY PERCY.

I will not sing.



HOTSPUR.

’Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be redbreast-teacher.

An the indentures be drawn, I’ll away within these two hours;

and so, come in when ye will.



[Exit.]

GLENDOWER.

Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow

As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.

By this our book’s drawn; we’ll but seal, and then

To horse immediately.



MORTIMER.

With all my heart.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE II. London. A Room in the Palace.


[Enter King Henry, Prince Henry, and Lords.]

KING.

Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I

Must have some private conference: but be near at hand,

For we shall presently have need of you.



[Exeunt Lords.]

I know not whether God will have it so,

For some displeasing service I have done,

That, in His secret doom, out of my blood

He’ll breed revengement and a scourge for me;

But thou dost, in thy passages of life,

Make me believe that thou art only mark’d

For the hot vengeance and the rod of Heaven

To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,

Could such inordinate and low desires,

Such poor, such base, such lewd, such mean attempts,

Such barren pleasures, rude society,

As thou art match’d withal and grafted to,

Accompany the greatness of thy blood,

And hold their level with thy princely heart?



PRINCE.

So please your Majesty, I would I could

Quit all offences with as clear excuse

As well as I am doubtless I can purge

Myself of many I am charged withal:

Yet such extenuation let me beg,

As, in reproof of many tales devised

By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,—

Which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,—

I may, for some things true, wherein my youth

Hath faulty wander’d and irregular,

Find pardon on my true submission.



KING.

God pardon thee! Yet let me wonder, Harry,

At thy affections, which do hold a wing

Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.

Thy place in Council thou hast rudely lost,

Which by thy younger brother is supplied;

And art almost an alien to the hearts

Of all the Court and princes of my blood:

The hope and expectation of thy time

Is ruin’d; and the soul of every man

Prophetically does forethink thy fall.

Had I so lavish of my presence been,

So common-hackney’d in the eyes of men,

So stale and cheap to vulgar company,

Opinion, that did help me to the crown,

Had still kept loyal to possession,

And left me in reputeless banishment,



A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.

By being seldom seen, I could not stir

But, like a comet, I was wonder’d at;

That men would tell their children, This is he;

Others would say, Where, which is Bolingbroke?

And then I stole all courtesy from Heaven,

And dress’d myself in such humility,

That I did pluck allegiance from men’s hearts,

Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,

Even in the presence of the crowned King.

Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;

My presence, like a robe pontifical,

Ne’er seen but wonder’d at: and so my state,

Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast,

And won by rareness such solemnity.

The skipping King, he ambled up and down

With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,

Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,

Mingled his royalty, with capering fools;

Had his great name profaned with their scorns;

And gave his countenance, against his name,

To laugh at gibing boys, and stand the push

Of every beardless vain comparative;

Grew a companion to the common streets,

Enfeoff’d himself to popularity;

That, being dally swallow’d by men’s eyes,

They surfeited with honey, and began

To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little

More than a little is by much too much.

So, when he had occasion to be seen,

He was but as the cuckoo is in June,

Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes

As, sick and blunted with community,

Afford no extraordinary gaze,

Such as is bent on sun-like majesty

When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;

But rather drowsed, and hung their eyelids down,

Slept in his face, and render’d such aspect

As cloudy men use to their adversaries,

Being with his presence glutted, gorged, and full.

And in that very line, Harry, stand’st thou;

For thou hast lost thy princely privilege

With vile participation: not an eye

But is a-weary of thy common sight,

Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;

Which now doth that I would not have it do,

Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.



PRINCE.

I shall hereafter, my thrice-gracious lord,

Be more myself.



KING.

For all the world,

As thou art to this hour, was Richard then

When I from France set foot at Ravenspurg;

And even as I was then is Percy now.

Now, by my sceptre, and my soul to boot,

He hath more worthy interest to the state

Than thou, the shadow of succession;

For, of no right, nor colour like to right,

He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,

Turns head against the lion’s armed jaws;

And, being no more in debt to years than thou,

Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on

To bloody battles and to bruising arms.

What never-dying honour hath he got

Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,

Whose hot incursions, and great name in arms,

Holds from all soldiers chief majority

And military title capital

Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:

Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathing-clothes,

This infant warrior, in his enterprises

Discomfited great Douglas; ta’en him once,

Enlarged him, and made a friend of him,

To fill the mouth of deep defiance up,

And shake the peace and safety of our throne.

And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,

Th’ Archbishop’s Grace of York, Douglas, and Mortimer

Capitulate against us, and are up.

But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?

Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,

Which art my near’st and dearest enemy?

Thou that art like enough,—through vassal fear,

Base inclination, and the start of spleen,—

To fight against me under Percy’s pay,

To dog his heels, and curtsy at his frowns,

To show how much thou art degenerate.



PRINCE.

Do not think so; you shall not find it so:

And God forgive them that so much have sway’d

Your Majesty’s good thoughts away from me!

I will redeem all this on Percy’s head,

And, in the closing of some glorious day,

Be bold to tell you that I am your son;

When I will wear a garment all of blood,

And stain my favour in a bloody mask,

Which, wash’d away, shall scour my shame with it:

And that shall be the day, whene’er it lights,

That this same child of honour and renown,

This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,

And your unthought-of Harry, chance to meet.

For every honour sitting on his helm,

Would they were multitudes, and on my head

My shames redoubled! for the time will come,

That I shall make this northern youth exchange

His glorious deeds for my indignities.

Percy is but my factor, good my lord,

T’ engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;

And I will call hall to so strict account,

That he shall render every glory up,

Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,

Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.

This, in the name of God, I promise here:

The which if I perform, and do survive,

I do beseech your Majesty, may salve

The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:

If not, the end of life cancels all bands;

And I will die a hundred thousand deaths

Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.



KING.

A hundred thousand rebels die in this.

Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.—



[Enter Sir Walter Blunt.]

How now, good Blunt! thy looks are full of speed.

BLUNT.

So is the business that I come to speak of.

Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word

That Douglas and the English rebels met

Th’ eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury:

A mighty and a fearful head they are,

If promises be kept on every hand,

As ever offer’d foul play in a State.



KING.

The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;

With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;

For this advertisement is five days old.

On Wednesday next you, Harry, shall set forward;

On Thursday we ourselves will march:

Our meeting is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you

Shall march through Glostershire; by which account,

Our business valued, some twelve days hence

Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.

Our hands are full of business: let’s away;

Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.



[Exeunt.]





SCENE III. Eastcheap. A Room in the Boar’s-Head Tavern.


[Enter Falstaff and Bardolph.]

FALSTAFF.

Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why, my skin hangs about me like an old lady’s loose gown; I am withered like an old apple-John. Well, I’ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I shall have no strength to repent. An I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer’s horse: the inside of a church! Company, villainous company, hath been the spoil of me.

BARDOLPH.

Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.



FALSTAFF.

Why, there is it: come, sing me a song; make me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not above seven times a week; paid money that I borrowed —three or four times; lived well, and in good compass: and now I live out of all order, out of all compass.

BARDOLPH.

Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs be out of all compass, —out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.

FALSTAFF.

Do thou amend thy face, and I’ll amend my life: thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in the poop,—but ’tis in the nose of thee; thou art the Knight of the Burning Lamp.

BARDOLPH.

Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.



FALSTAFF.

No, I’ll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many a man doth of a death’s-head or a memento mori: I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire, and Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath should be, By this fire, that’s God’s angel: but thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but for the light in thy face, the son of utter darkness. When thou rann’st up Gad’s-hill in the night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire, there’s no purchase in money. O, thou art a perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light! Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler’s in Europe. I have maintain’d that salamander of yours with fire any time this two-and-thirty years; God reward me for it!

BARDOLPH.

’Sblood, I would my face were in your stomach!



FALSTAFF.

God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burn’d.—



[Enter the Hostess.]

How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you enquir’d yet who pick’d my pocket?

HOSTESS.

Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you think I keep thieves in my house? I have search’d, I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before.

FALSTAFF.

Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved, and lost many a hair; and

I’ll be sworn my pocket was pick’d. Go to, you are a woman, go.



HOSTESS.

Who, I? no; I defy thee: God’s light, I was never call’d so in mine own house before.

FALSTAFF.

Go to, I know you well enough.



HOSTESS.

No, Sir John; you do not know me, Sir John. I know you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought you a dozen of shirts to your back.

FALSTAFF.

Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to bakers’ wives, and they have made bolters of them.

HOSTESS.

Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight shillings an ell.

You owe money here besides, Sir John, for your diet and by-drinkings,

and money lent you, four-and-twenty pound.



FALSTAFF.

He had his part of it; let him pay.



HOSTESS.

He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.



FALSTAFF.

How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich? let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks: I’ll not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker of me? shall I not take mine ease in mine inn, but I shall have my pocket pick’d? I have lost a seal-ring of my grandfather’s worth forty mark.

HOSTESS.

O Jesu, I have heard the Prince tell him, I know not how oft, that that ring was copper!

FALSTAFF.

How! the Prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: ’sblood, an he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he would say so.—

[Enter Prince Henry and Poins, marching. Falstaff meets them, playing on his truncheon like a fife.]

How now, lad? is the wind in that door, i’faith? must we all march?

BARDOLPH.

Yea, two-and-two, Newgate-fashion.



HOSTESS.

My lord, I pray you, hear me.



PRINCE.

What say’st thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.

HOSTESS.

Good my lord, hear me.



FALSTAFF.

Pr’ythee, let her alone, and list to me.



PRINCE.

What say’st thou, Jack?



FALSTAFF.

The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras, and had my pocket pick’d: this house is turn’d bawdy-house; they pick pockets.

PRINCE.

What didst thou lose, Jack?



FALSTAFF.

Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of forty pound a-piece and a seal-ring of my grandfather’s.

PRINCE.

A trifle, some eight-penny matter.



HOSTESS.

So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your Grace say so; and, my lord, he speaks most vilely of you, like a foul-mouth’d man as he is; and said he would cudgel you.

PRINCE.

What! he did not?



HOSTESS.

There’s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.



FALSTAFF.

There’s no more faith in thee than in a stew’d prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox; and, for woman-hood, Maid Marian may be the deputy’s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing, go.

HOSTESS.

Say, what thing? what thing? I am an honest man’s wife: and, setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to call me so.

FALSTAFF.

Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say otherwise.



HOSTESS.

Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?



FALSTAFF.

What beast! why, an otter.



PRINCE.

An otter, Sir John, why an otter?



FALSTAFF.

Why, she’s neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not where to have her.

HOSTESS.

Thou art an unjust man in saying so; thou or any man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!

PRINCE.

Thou say’st true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.



HOSTESS.

So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound.

PRINCE.

Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?



FALSTAFF.



A thousand pound, Hal! a million: thy love is worth a million; thou owest me thy love.

HOSTESS.

Nay, my lord, he call’d you Jack, and said he would cudgel you.



FALSTAFF.

Did I, Bardolph?



BARDOLPH.

Indeed, Sir John, you said so.



FALSTAFF.

Yea, if he said my ring was copper.



PRINCE.

I say ’tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?



FALSTAFF.

Why, Hal, thou know’st, as thou art but man, I dare; but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the roaring of the lion’s whelp.

PRINCE.

And why not as the lion?



FALSTAFF.

The King himself is to be feared as the lion: dost thou think I’ll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an I do, I pray God my girdle break.

PRINCE.

Sirrah, there’s no room for faith, truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all fill’d up with midriff. Charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson, impudent, emboss’d rascal, if there were anything in thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, and one poor pennyworth of sugar-candy to make thee long-winded,—if thy pocket were enrich’d with any other injuries but these, I am a villain: and yet you will stand to it; you will not pocket-up wrong. Art thou not ashamed!

FALSTAFF.

Dost thou hear, Hal? thou know’st, in the state of innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack Falstaff do in the days of villainy? Thou see’st I have more flesh than another man; and therefore more frailty. You confess, then, you pick’d my pocket?

PRINCE.

It appears so by the story.

FALSTAFF.

Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast; love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason; thou see’st I am pacified.—Still? Nay, pr’ythee, be gone.

[Exit Hostess.]

Now, Hal, to the news at Court: for the robbery, lad, how is that answered?

PRINCE.

O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to thee: the money is paid back again.

FALSTAFF.

O, I do not like that paying back; ’tis a double labour.



PRINCE.

I am good friends with my father, and may do any thing.



FALSTAFF.

Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and do it with unwash’d hands too.

BARDOLPH.

Do, my lord.



PRINCE.

I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of Foot.



FALSTAFF.

I would it had been of Horse. Where shall I find one that can steal well? O, for a fine thief, of the age of two-and-twenty or thereabouts! I am heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for these rebels; they offend none but the virtuous: I laud them, I praise them.

PRINCE.

Bardolph,—



BARDOLPH.

My lord?



PRINCE.

Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster,

To my brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.—

[Exit Bardolph.]

Go, Poins, to horse, to horse; for thou and I

Have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner-time.—



[Exit Poins.]

Meet me to-morrow, Jack, i’ the Temple-hall

At two o’clock in th’ afternoon:

There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive

Money and order for their furniture.

The land is burning; Percy stands on high;

And either they or we must lower lie.



[Exit.]

FALSTAFF.

Rare words! brave world!—Hostess, my breakfast; come:—

O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!



[Exit.]





ACT IV


SCENE I. The Rebel Camp near Shrewsbury.


[Enter Hotspur, Worcester, and Douglas.]

HOTSPUR.

Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth

In this fine age were not thought flattery,

Such attribution should the Douglas have,

As not a soldier of this season’s stamp

Should go so general-current through the world.

By God, I cannot flatter; I defy

The tongues of soothers; but a braver place

In my heart’s love hath no man than yourself:

Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.



DOUGLAS.

Thou art the king of honour:

No man so potent breathes upon the ground

But I will beard him.



HOTSPUR.

Do so, and ’tis well.—



[Enter a Messenger with letters.]

What letters hast thou there?—I can but thank you.

MESSENGER.

These letters come from your father.



HOTSPUR.

Letters from him! why comes he not himself?



MESSENGER.

He cannot come, my lord; he’s grievous sick.



HOTSPUR.

Zwounds! how has he the leisure to be sick

In such a justling time? Who leads his power?

Under whose government come they along?



MESSENGER.

His letters bears his mind, not I, my lord.



WORCESTER.

I pr’ythee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?



MESSENGER.

He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth,

And at the time of my departure thence

He was much fear’d by his physicians.



WORCESTER.

I would the state of time had first been whole

Ere he by sickness had been visited:

His health was never better worth than now.



HOTSPUR.

Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect

The very life-blood of our enterprise;

’Tis catching hither, even to our camp.



He writes me here, that inward sickness,—

And that his friends by deputation could not

So soon be drawn; no did he think it meet

To lay so dangerous and dear a trust

On any soul removed, but on his own.

Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,

That with our small conjunction we should on,

To see how fortune is disposed to us;

For, as he writes, there is no quailing now,

Because the King is certainly possess’d

Of all our purposes. What say you to it?



WORCESTER.

Your father’s sickness is a maim to us.



HOTSPUR.

A perilous gash, a very limb lopp’d off:—

And yet, in faith, ’tis not; his present want

Seems more than we shall find it. Were it good

To set the exact wealth of all our states

All at one cast? to set so rich a main

On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?

It were not good; for therein should we read

The very bottom and the soul of hope,

The very list, the very utmost bound

Of all our fortunes.



DOUGLAS.

Faith, and so we should;

Where now remains a sweet reversion;

And we may boldly spend upon the hope

Of what is to come in:

A comfort of retirement lives in this.



HOTSPUR.

A rendezvous, a home to fly unto,

If that the Devil and mischance look big

Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.



WORCESTER.

But yet I would your father had been here.

The quality and hair of our attempt

Brooks no division: it will be thought

By some, that know not why he is away,

That wisdom, loyalty, and mere dislike

Of our proceedings, kept the earl from hence:

And think how such an apprehension

May turn the tide of fearful faction,

And breed a kind of question in our cause;

For well you know we of the offering side

Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,

And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence

The eye of reason may pry in upon us.

This absence of your father’s draws a curtain,

That shows the ignorant a kind of fear

Before not dreamt of.



HOTSPUR.

Nay, you strain too far.

I, rather, of his absence make this use:

It lends a lustre and more great opinion,

A larger dare to our great enterprise,

Than if the earl were here; for men must think,

If we, without his help, can make a head

To push against the kingdom, with his help

We shall o’erturn it topsy-turvy down.

Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.



DOUGLAS.

As heart can think: there is not such a word

Spoke in Scotland as this term of fear.



[Enter Sir Richard Vernon.]

HOTSPUR.

My cousin Vernon! welcome, by my soul.



VERNON.

Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.

The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,

Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.



HOTSPUR.

No harm: what more?



VERNON.

And further, I have learn’d

The King himself in person is set forth,

Or hitherwards intended speedily,

With strong and mighty preparation.



HOTSPUR.

He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,

The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,

And his comrades, that daff the world aside,

And bid it pass?
